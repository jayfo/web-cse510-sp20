<h2 id="project-theme">Project Theme</h2>
<p>As a focus for Winter 2020, we asked students to explore <strong>self-tracking and everyday interaction with personal intelligences</strong>.</p>
<p>People have long sought to better understand themselves, but continuing technology advances enable new approaches.
Students examined problems people encounter in gathering and gaining value from personal data,
then explored how a combination of design and machine intelligence can
help go beyond simple data fetishes to help people in using personal data as part of reaching their goals.</p>

<h3 id="problem-overview">Problem Overview</h3>
<p>Alcohol is ubiquitous throughout cultural spaces. It is a source of entertainment, but also of danger, expenses, and health complications. Alcohol's association with forgetting responsibilities makes mechanisms of self-moderation unpopular. To date, none have been adopted at scale. Yet, habitual drinking, uncertain limits, and overspending remain a prevalent issue.</p>
<p>Many existing tools fall into the pattern of &quot;data-fetishism&quot;. The drinker experiences novel amusement toward trends in their consumption before ultimately discarding the app. Others are too heavy-handed, requiring one to drag out their phone to record statistics. Our goal is to approach this problem from an angle that encourages and rewards habits of mindful consumption while recognizing one's existing goals and social contexts.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<p>We conducted semi-structured interviews with college students who frequently consume alcohol and funds while out with friends. We chose interviews due to the complication of a contextual inquiry on inebriated individuals. College students were our primary population of interest due to their frequent involvement in drinking, socialization, and the purchase of alcohol while on a limited budget.</p>
<h4 id="goals">Goals</h4>
<p>Our interview prompts started out broad and on the explorative side and grew to be more focused around identifying the topics below.</p>
<ul>
<li>People’s motivations for self regulation.</li>
<li>Sources of frustration in current moderation and tracking methods.</li>
<li>Methods tried before by them or their friends.</li>
<li>Challenges that come with different environments in which they consume alcohol.</li>
<li>Confidence in their general knowledge about alcohol.</li>
<li>Personal signs that they or their friends have consumed too much.</li>
<li>Actions that they would like to have access to or find intriguing but can not perform right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the initial interviews were less effective in identifying a final design but helped us iterate on our interview scripts and create specific questions that we needed for making an informed choice for our final design. Indications that occasional binge drinking was intentional and desirable to social drinkers led us to refocus on participants experiences around the intersection of drinking and spending.</p>
<h4 id="participants">Participants</h4>
<p>We tried to choose participants that are still in college and have a decent amount of drinking experience. We also tried to have diversity in gender to and their majors. Finally we also interviewed a bartender to get the insight from the other side. For the bartender interview a different custom script was used. Overall during our research we ended up conducting interviews with six participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asian female. Majoring in Informatics. Drinks 1 - 5 times a week.</li>
<li>Asian male. 21 years old. Majoring in HCD. Drinks once a month.</li>
<li>Asian male. 21 years old. Majoring in CS. Drinks once a week.</li>
<li>White male. 22 years old. Majoring in Physics. Drinks 1 - 2 times a week.</li>
<li>Asian female. 19 years old. Majoring in Communications. Drinks a couple times a month.</li>
<li>Asian female. 21 years old. Works as a bartender.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="results-themes">Results &amp; Themes</h3>
<p><strong>”Ballpark” tracking methods are enjoyed for their simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Many participants tracked the amount of drinks they’ve had in their head, or on their arm with a marker. The bartender mentioned receipts being used by customers to keep a tally of drinks. Most participants lacked motivation to comprehensively log drinks due to inconvenience and risk of being labeled as “no fun”. Participants were resistant to the idea of pulling out their phone to track drinks, but saw the social impact of tracking amongst their friends as a non-issue. In fact, some participants perceived counting their drinks as a mechanism to show that you can handle a lot of alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>Drinkers are aware of short-term risks, but they sometimes ignore what they know</strong></p>
<p>Participants shared concerns about “blacking-out” and personal safety. One participant shared a salient memory of a friend’s emergency room visit after alcohol poisoning. The sentiment that <em>“It’s rarely worth it to get that drunk”</em> recognizes the dangers of overconsumption, but this line between <em>“a good amount drunk”</em> and <em>“too much”</em> seemed like something participants relied on past experience and physical sensation to gauge.</p>
<p><strong>Social drinkers distribute their drinking across locations</strong></p>
<p>Participants described moving locations frequently during nights out with their friends. One participant explained, <em>“Last Saturday, two days ago. I pregamed here and went out to a bar and then a club. I was with a group of friends.”</em>. This notion of “pre-gaming” and “kick-backs” was echoed throughout responses, and indicates that consecutive instances of drinking and spending may not always be co-located. Furthermore, the vendor of the alcohol was often a friend rather than a cashier.</p>
<p><strong>Nights out are expensive, and can involve a unanticipated expenses</strong></p>
<p>Many participants expressed difficulties regulating spending, with drinks, food, and ride-share services. Many of them offered estimation of their expenses, with the three highest spending $50, $60, and $80 per night. For frequent drinkers, this is a significant life expense that is difficult to trace due to the distribution of expenses across varying locations and type of purchase. Some participants attempted to set personal allowances, but had varying success in sticking to their goals. Another participant was comfortable being less vigilant <em>”I just swipe my card and I don’t keep track. I just sign it and I’m good to go</em>”.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>With our results in mind we carefully examined what was the current experience for our participants and what they were interested and motivated in pursuing. This led us to boil the possible achievable tasks to the ones listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Preventing overspending on alcohol and food on a night out.</strong>
We have found that monetary impact of drinking is the most appealing motivation factor for attempting to moderate yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowing the total amount you spend on a night out.</strong>
While similar in theme to previous task, many participants expressed concerns in aggressive moderation tactics and would rather just make their own conclusions based on the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selecting drinks to your taste, budget, and tolerance level.</strong>
Many participants were not very well informed in how much alcohol they were consuming and showed interest in personalized assistance for nights out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keeping track of how many drinks you have had.</strong>
While the task itself is fairly straightforward there are many challenges in doing this effectively and unobtrusively on a smart device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Having emergency contacts readily available for others to help.</strong>
Being able to effectively help your friends and allow others to help you is one of the only aspects of consuming too much that our participants took seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notifying someone when you’re in an uncomfortable situation.</strong>
Outside of just having the information readily available, being able to easily send an SOS like message to an emergency contact when you are out drinking is a feature often requested by our participants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposal-sketches">Proposal Sketches</h3>
<p>There are three design spaces that we decided to explore. Each attempts to provide a solution to a slightly different subset of tasks and approaches the general problem of moderation from a novel angle.</p>
<h4 id="mobile-application">Mobile Application</h4>
<p>The main goal of the mobile application is to allow for a clear way to set and track spending goals. This design approaches the task by providing an insightful and feature full application that can be used before and after a night out to track your progress. There also extra features that allow you to reach out to an emergency contact for yourself or your friends.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/mobile_app_design.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/mobile_app_design_2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="smart-watch-application">Smart Watch Application</h4>
<p>The smart watch design attempts to reuse existing hardware to provide a smarter solution for counting your drinks. Most of the interactions would happen on the actual watch face itself. While the amount of information displayed is much more limited, the ability to track and review the information in a convenient way differentiates this design from others.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smart_watch_app_design.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="smart-bracelet">Smart Bracelet</h4>
<p>A device specifically designed to be able to count your drinks allows for a more focused solution. While this design presents the most limited amount of information compared to others, it also provides both a subtler way to track and a combination of visual and tactile way of presenting the count of drinks consumed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smart_bracelet_design.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="selected-design">Selected Design</h3>
<p>We chose to pursue a design that incorporates both a smart watch and a phone app. This allows us to both keep count of drinks consumed and track spending in an effective manner.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/selected_design.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>During our research, many participants expressed disinterest in moderation techniques that required extensive time and attention. Many were also reluctant to buy any new hardware for alcohol moderation due to doubt in effectiveness and convenience of any extra devices. They did display interest in something that integrates with their existing devices, such as a smart watch. This motivated us to pick a design that would take advantage of the existing smartwatch hardware and provide the convenience of your wrist while still backing it up with a full-fledged mobile app. Unlike other designs, it lends us the opportunity to project a streamlined interface to the wearer that is accessible during the act of drinking, while reserving the more complicated, descriptive tasks like reviewing your progress or adjusting your goals for the phone application. We believe physically separating the modes of goal-limited drinking and goal-setting could prevent social drinkers from feeling intruded on during their nights out, while still retaining the tools necessary to subtly keep themselves accountable. In our design we chose to target the tasks of keeping track of how much you drank and knowing the total amount you spent on a night out. These two tasks aligned the best with the core desires that our participants displayed. The information gathered during tracking your drinks and your spending is also an essential prerequisite for allowing the user to try and tackle the other tasks that we considered such as preventing overspending or reaching out to an emergency contact when someone over-consumes. Rather than imposing one specific goal, such as complete sobriety, our aim is to provide the wearer with an interface through which to set goals like saving money, learning limits, and cutting back on alcohol ahead-of-time. Then, the wearer can measure and evaluate their performance in comparison to those goals.</p>
<h4 id="storyboard-1">Storyboard 1</h4>
<p>Counting drinks effectively on a night out is very helpful in allowing a person to identify that they should stop. Let us illustrate it by following our hero Otis through a series of events. Otis and his friends are out at a bar and one person suggests doing another round of drinks. Otis habitually checks his watch and realizes that he has consumed more than he thought. Based on this information he decides to take a pass and enjoys the rest of his night out, confident in his choice.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard_1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="storyboard-2">Storyboard 2</h4>
<p>Realizing that you have spent too much can also serve as a great trigger to reconsider your actions. This time Otis is out at a club and he is having a great time. He offers to purchase drinks for his friends and continues to get drinks for some strangers. Yet after seeing how much he has spent he starts worrying about paying for his rent and even paying for his next meal. He decides to stop his spending for the night, feeling like he is making an informed choice.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-prioritizing-sleep">The Problem: Prioritizing Sleep</h3>
<p>Sleep is a critical part of growth and development. It is surprising, then, that sleep is so often neglected by
college students. As the lives of students become more crowded and complex, where does sleep fit in? Between
studies, work, extracurricular activities, and social events, many students fail to find the time to do everything
and end up sacrificing sleep as a result. Our group wants to examine sleeping habits of adolescents, focusing on
this central question:</p>
<p><strong>How do we facilitate proper sleeping habits for those that can sleep earlier but won't?</strong></p>
<p>Our solution, a smart pillow, uses tracking to empower users and inform them on ways to improve their sleeping habits.
In our design process, we determined that our solution needed to inform users on the effects of a healthy sleep
schedule and furthermore needed to encourage healthier sleep. A smart pillow allows us to gather the data necessary
and a companion app gave us the ability to educate users on sleeping habits more effectively. Here, we will describe
the evolution of our design and how we were able to reach a smart pillow.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals">Design Research Goals:</h3>
<p>To learn about sleeping habits of our target demographic, we chose three main research methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>A questionnaire to gauge general trends</li>
<li>A diary study to gain in depth insights on sleeping habits of individual students</li>
<li>An expert interview to learn about the science of sleep and how it affects our demographic</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questionnaire">Questionnaire</h4>
<p>Our questionnaire was designed specifically with the intention of gaining large scale insights into the sleeping habits
of our target demographic: college-aged adolescents. In order to accomplish this, we crafted questions to be simple
and unintrusive. The survey itself was anonymous and short, allowing us to more effectively gather responses from
a wide range of people. The survey would inform us on the needs of the general population we were dealing with and
how to best tackle our problem. Questions covered demographic information, sleep routine, fatigue, and sleep disorders.
The variety in questions would give us a broad data set that we could draw key insights from.</p>
<h4 id="diary-study">Diary Study</h4>
<p>We chose to do a diary study to complement the questionnaire. The questionnaire enabled us to find a large quantity
of research participants. However, we felt the need to go more in depth with our research to find out what specific
parts of a sleep routine were important to study. We attempted to study this by doing a diary study. Our main goal
throughout the process was to identify what parts of a person's life most affected sleep. We asked participants to
fill out a detailed journal for approximately 4 days, including information about daily routine, bedtime rituals,
sleep quality, and mood or fatigue. The diaries went much farther in depth to help us find out more about the factors
affecting a person's sleep.</p>
<h4 id="expert-interview">Expert Interview</h4>
<p>For our expert interview, we reached out to several people regarding an interview.
Due to limited time availability of such experts, we were able to successfully arrange one interview.
This expert sleep researcher's work and experience perfectly fit our project's scope.
We met with her after the majority of our research had concluded (due to availability constraints).
She was a fantastic resource and we felt compelled to talk to her.
The focus of our questions was mainly sleep and its relationship with adolescent growth and development.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results">Design Research Results:</h3>
<h4 id="questionnaire-2">Questionnaire</h4>
<p>The questionnaire we distributed received 48 responses. The participants came from a variety of majors and had class
standings ranging from freshmen to PhD students. We gained many insights from the surveys. 75% of students reported
sleeping after 12am on weekdays, 85% of people reported sleeping after 12am on weekends, and most importantly, <strong>69%</strong>
of participants revealed that they had attempted to change their sleeping habits but failed. We saw there was a clear
need for tracking to aide one's ability to sleep and to encourage our population to prioritize sleep more than they
currently are. More specifically, we learned that <strong>effects of sleep deprivation varied greatly within the population of college students</strong>.
This meant that our design would need to be universal, learning about the user then adjusting to the individual.
Additionally, we found that <strong>effective sleep routines remained consistent</strong>. By this we mean that consistency of
bedtime in addition to duration of sleep improved mood and fatigue by a lot.</p>
<h4 id="diary-study-2">Diary Study</h4>
<p>In our diary study, we had six participants journal for about four days. Reading through the information given to us
gave us insight into how to design our solution. The first insight we gained from reading through our journals was how
<strong>events throughout the entire day affected sleep quality</strong>. We saw that many participants indicated lower quality of sleep
on days that were negative or sad. The activities or schedule of a person can greatly influence their sleep, even if said
activites took place in the middle of the day. The relationship also worked in the other direction as we had observed many people
experiencing worse attittude on days where they had gotten minimal sleep the night before. The next insight we found
was the <strong>importance of sleep environment</strong>. Each person's environment was different and we found that
<strong>many factors contributing to sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality were controllable</strong>. Things that are known to have a huge effect
on sleep that we found affected participants in our diary study were light and noise, specifically blue light.
Participants had noted that blue light from devices often played a huge role in their sleep loss.</p>
<h4 id="expert-interview-2">Expert Interview</h4>
<p>Our interview with the expert sleep researcher yielded a plethora of information to consider in our design. We prepared a series of
questions beforehand and learned a lot about her work and research. Because this was after our checkpoint was due,
we had time to discuss our findings from the questionnaire and diary study. Our conversation yielded a
few key insights. She discussed with us
the <strong>importance of data</strong> and how it could be used to improve people's sleep and by consequence the rest of their lives.
We additionally discussed details of sleep and how it affects college students in particular. An extremely interesting part
of the interview revolved around <strong>circadian rhythm and how it varies within our population</strong>. It further changed our
thinking about sleep habits. We knew the solution we came up with would need to be universal and able to accommodate
a variety of students' needs. Overall the interview was fun and informative. We drew from the interview when designing
the gamification of our app and when thinking about how to best meet the needs of the diverse population.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>We identify the following six tasks to be important to our design:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating social progress trackers shared between users as a social experience to encourage better sleep routines
and accountability</p>
<p>This idea originated as a sleep competition, but over the course of our research, we redefined it to be a social
progress tracker. The incentive to sleep is not very strong for many people, so we want to provide some kind of
progress tracker that not only displays one's data for their own growth, but also shares it to encourage others
to follow their good example. Our goal with this task is not only to share good practices, but also to challenge
existing notions of sleep as a low priority. We want a way to encourage people to sleep more and to move away from
a culture that tolerates or even celebrates prioritizing other responsibilities over sleep and personal well-being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Displaying clear and straightforward data regarding their sleep routine and physical health for people</p>
<p>Our solution needs to be personal, helping users based on their specific needs. Because of this, a major part of
our approach is centered on showing people their own data so they can make decisions about how to best improve their
sleep. Our design needed to help the user figure out what works best for them instead of basing decisions off of
generalized data. Part of that is communicating sleep data in a way that's simple and concise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivating a relaxed mindset and environment for better sleep</p>
<p>Our research showed that the environment a person sleeps in has a major effect on their sleep patterns. Things
such as light, noise, and temperature should be taken into account by our design. More generally, our design
needed to inform the user on what external factors were in their control that could be affecting their sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encouraging people to reconsider how they prioritize sleep</p>
<p>One of the main focuses of our project from the start was encouraging people to reprioritize sleep. For students
with many major responsibilities, sleep is often a low priority. When faced with high pressure from deadlines,
people will often stay up late to finish something. Our design should discourage this by encouraging users to
reexamine their priorities and plan ahead to prevent situations occurring where they are forced to stay up late.
Sleep and self-care should be encouraged and prioritized above school, work, or other responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping people adapt a balanced daily schedule to avoid conflicting with their sleep routine/circadian rhythm</p>
<p>As we discovered from our interview with an expert sleep researcher, sleep can differ greatly among individuals and the most
challenging group to cater to would be those whose sleep schedules didn't align with their day-to-day responsibilities.
Some people experience the most focus and productivity at night, for instance, and consequently struggle to find a
sleep schedule that accommodates their work or school. One of our tasks is to help people like this by finding
a way to eliminate or at least mitigate the difficulties associated with their sleep routine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informing people how sleep can help accomplish their goals</p>
<p>Our final goal is to teach people how sleep can help them accomplish their goals. It isn't uncommon for people to
ignore sleep's effects on their lives. People can sometimes see sleep as a natural part of their routine and don't
give any further consideration to its improvement. People don't think about how getting more sleep can help one's
entire life and instead treat it as wasted time. In reality, sleep is almost like an investment. The time spent
sleeping isn't wasted. In fact, sleep deprivation is linked to several health conditions and poorer performance in
school or work. We want our solution to inform people of this and change the attitude towards sleep to be more
positive, making it a necessity instead of a chore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposed-designs">Proposed Designs</h3>
<h4 id="smart-ring-bracelet">Smart Ring/Bracelet</h4>
<p>Our first design was a smart ring or bracelet. The idea was to have a wearable device that would track vital information
during sleep. The device could be used as an alarm and could be used without a phone or computer. The smart ring would
have a companion app that focused primarily on communicating data to the user, but would be out of the way to discourage
phone use before bed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smartring.png" alt="smart ring" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>
<h4 id="alarm-clock">Alarm Clock</h4>
<p>Our second design was an alarm clock. An alarm clock was a natural choice of form since it is already a part of many people's
routines. It would be a convenient and subtle way to make it easy for people to gather data. Unlike our other approaches, an
alarm clock would not require a companion app. Instead it could track data and provide insights to the user itself without
having to connect to a device or the internet. The form factor allowed for a wide array of sensors for the environment a
person sleeps in, but couldn't truly track information about the user themselves without manual input. In addition, the approach
using a device that worked independently of a computer or internet allowed for greater privacy and security of data.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/alarmclock.png" alt="alarm clock" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>
<h4 id="smart-pillow">Smart Pillow</h4>
<p>Our final design was a smart pillow. This design contrasted with our other approaches because it was already a part of most
people's sleep, and we thought if we could get the cost low enough, it would be an easier sell because of that. The pillow
is primarily used to track data. Using flexible sensors and memory foam we wanted to gather data on factors relating to sleep.
A companion app could be used to visualize and share this data. Additionally, the pillow could house a speaker, a small motor,
or even a heater to get a desired sleeping environment.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/pillowapp.png" alt="pillow" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>Our selected design is the smart pillow. We chose the smart pillow because this design would allow for accurate and
thorough data collection while still remaining convenient for our users. It would therefore be the best way to engage
our target audience. If we are able to maintain a low cost relative to normal pillows, we believe this design will be
the best and easiest to get college students to adopt.</p>
<h4 id="storyboard-1">Storyboard 1:</h4>
<p>Our first scenario involves the social progress tracker. It is used as an extrinsic motivation for a healthy sleep
routine. A person can see other people's progress and has a character that models their own health. Having such
data motivates our user to finish his work and sleep earlier.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.jpg" alt="storyboard 1" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>
<h4 id="storyboard-2">Storyboard 2:</h4>
<p>Our second scenario describes Richard, who struggles to sleep due to his obsession with his phone. It demonstrates
how a smart pillow can help a user gather data and help them go to sleep without the necessity of a phone.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard2.png" alt="storyboard 2" style="width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto; border: 2px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px #555" /></p>

TODO: It would be nice to have a place to put their tagline
Helping dogs maintain a healthy weight
--> 
<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>The problem we are addressing is obesity in dogs. We are seeking ways to help dog owners help their pets lose enough weight to be considered healthy or maintain their already healthy weight. Our solution is a smart dog collar and app combination that tracks when and where a dog eats, as well as tracking information associated with exercise and calorie consumption. Tracking these data points will help give owners enough information to be able to make informed decisions to help keep their pets healthy.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<h4 id="design-focus-primary-need-for-additional-understanding">Design Focus &amp; Primary Need for Additional Understanding</h4>
<p>Our initial focus has remained the same throughout our project - helping dog owners address their dogs’ weight. The primary things we needed to understand were the underlying causes for dog obesity and what helped perpetuate the weight issues. We felt that addressing these things would be the key to solving the issue.</p>
<h4 id="design-method-and-participants">Design Method and Participants</h4>
<p>To better understand the issue, we hoped to get information straight from the professionals. Our initial outreach and search for participants included veterinarians local to the Seattle area. The idea was that a veterinarian would know best how to address obesity within animals. We hoped to perform contextual inquiry, following around the veterinarians throughout their day. Unfortunately, due to liability issues and non-disclosure agreements, we were unable to get access to any veterinarians.</p>
<p>We proceeded to pivot entirely away from veterinarians, and more towards the dog owners themselves, using primarily semi-structured interviews to interview participants. The questions generally consisted of inquiries into their daily lives, what they considered healthy, their current actions to address their issues, and what information they wished they could have. In the case of some participants, we followed them throughout their day as they cared for their pets. In total, we interviewed 3 dog owners, a foster dog parent, and a professional dog walker.</p>
<p>While we wanted to get information regarding how to treat pet obesity from veterinarians, by pivoting to the owners themselves, our design goals solidified more towards helping dog owners do what they already do to address their pets’ obesity rather than starting from a blank canvas.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<p>Over the course of all the interviews, two themes stood out. The source of a dog’s calorie intake was the most prominent factor that our interviewees mentioned. This ended up influencing our design the greatest.</p>
<h4 id="food-sources-and-overeating">Food Sources and Overeating</h4>
<p>The biggest insight we developed was around the diet of the pet. We found that many owners were having trouble tracking every source of food given to their dogs. One of the participants we interviewed had two dogs. Their problem was unique in that one dog would eat their full meal when it was served to them, while the other preferred to eat a little at a time throughout the day. This ended up creating a problem where the one dog would end up eating their food, and then some of the other dog’s food. Another participant that we interviewed, Julie, also had a dog that steals food from the bowls of other dogs.</p>
<p>Another common theme we heard from multiple participants was how hard it was for them to say no to their dogs. People are so emotionally invested in their dogs that one owner said,  “it was hard to say no to his puppy-dog eyes.” This same owner often found out that his extended family was giving his overweight dog treats even when he asked them not to.  This correlated directly with the opinions of the professional dog walker: “Owners love their dogs so much, they often feel like it is mean to withhold food in any way.”</p>
<p>Many owners mentioned that they wished they had a way to be able track when their dog eats, especially when the owner isn’t around. It became clear that if we wanted to effectively help owners deal with dog obesity, figuring out a way to automatically track when a dog is being fed was vital.</p>
<h4 id="exercise">Exercise</h4>
<p>When a human wants to lose weight, the phrase most often quoted is “diet and exercise”. This holds true for dogs as well. Although we chose to focus more on the diet side of that equation, we didn't want to completely ignore exercise.</p>
<p>What we found through our interviews was that pet owners never tracked how much exercise their pets received. One owner mentioned that his dog received,  “about an hour of play and another hour of walking”. When prompted for more details, he didn’t know and hadn’t recorded specifics. When we asked owners about duration and distance of exercise, most of the comments we received were vague. Based on this, we decided that focusing on automatic exercise tracking would provide an obvious benefit.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Based on the interviews, we found that most participants don’t know how many calories their dogs consume daily and how much exercise their dogs get even though  these are the two most important factors influencing a dog’s weight. Therefore, we decide to create the six tasks below to help address the two problems, along with some other concerns that the participants have or lack of knowledge in.</p>
<h4 id="id-1-track-a-dog-s-weight-over-time-daily-weekly-and-monthly">1.  Track a dog’s weight over time, daily, weekly, and monthly</h4>
<p>The main goal of our design is to help dogs maintain a healthy weight. According to our interview responses, dog owners or dog caregivers, such as professional dog walkers, know that there would be slight fluctuations in dogs’ weights. They usually don’t notice their dogs gaining weight unless the weight gain can be visually seen. However, it is crucial to be aware of any weight gain in dogs in the early stage and start intervening immediately. Therefore, we found it helpful to track a dog’s weight over time (daily, weekly, and monthly). By doing this, it helps participants notice potential trends of weight gain, and also helps them to see how weight responds to variation in food intake and exercise.</p>
<h4 id="id-2-access-to-veterinarians-and-professional-help">2.  Access to veterinarians and professional help</h4>
<p>All of the dog owners we have interviewed expressed how busy they are dealing with things at school or work. They often didn’t have the time to get their dog regularly weighed. Also, they don’t have much experience and education in this area and preferred to consult veterinarians instead of making decisions on their own. Most of them talked about the desire for a quick and convenient way to consult veterinarians. Thus, we decided to add access to veterinarians as a task because a lot of dog owners rely on this means to determine whether their dogs are overweight.</p>
<h4 id="id-3-track-and-monitor-a-dog-s-exercise">3.  Track and monitor a dog’s exercise</h4>
<p>Exercise is one of the primary means for dogs to maintain a healthy weight. According to our interview responses,many owners don’t track or know how much their dogs are exercising. One of the dog owners we interviewed just let her dogs outside.  Another owner told us that the duration of exercise depends on how much time she has that day. It was clear how important tracking the exercise a dog is getting to inform the dog owners for them to make informed decisions on whether to exercise their dogs more.</p>
<h4 id="id-4-track-dog-s-body-shape">4.  Track dog’s body shape</h4>
<p>From our interview responses, we learned that some dog owners don’t have a scale at home to weigh their dog. Instead, they were taught by the veterinarians to feel for the ribs of their dogs. If the ribs can be felt distinctly, the dogs are not overweight. The reason this is taught is because dogs have a huge variance in what is considered a healthy weight. Things like size, age, sex, and breed are important factors when determining the correct weight range for a specific dog.  By reducing this complex formula to instead have an owner inspect a dog’s shape, it can provide a higher level of success. Therefore, tracking a dog’s body shape provides a more accurate judgment than the weight itself.</p>
<h4 id="id-5-track-which-dog-ate-from-the-food-bowl">5.  Track which dog ate from the food bowl</h4>
<p>Having multiple pets in one household can create an issue for owners as dogs’ don’t always feed themselves consistently. Some dogs prefer to graze throughout their day, while other dogs eat solely at their meal time. For owners with multiple dogs, this can cause an issue where an overweight dog could eat another dog’s food, making  their weight issue even worse. One of the interviewees has this situation. According to our interview findings, many owners can’t be home all day to monitor how many calories each dog consumes. Being able to automatically track when a dog’s eating, how much it eats, and from which food bowl, would help multiple-dog owners keep their pets healthy.</p>
<h4 id="id-6-track-a-dog-s-food-intake-from-various-sources">6.  Track a dog’s food intake from various sources</h4>
<p>Food intake is the primary factor affecting a dog’s weight. This can be a complex problem as there are so many varieties of dog food, each with their own calorie density. Also, based on our interviewees, many owners have trouble calculating exactly how many calories they are feeding their dogs based on the food labels. Meanwhile, dogs are often fed treats and scraps, and these calories are the most difficult to figure into their diet. Knowing the precise amount of calories a dog consumes would allow an owner to keep their dogs from becoming overweight.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-food-intake-and-weight-monitoring-device-suite">Design 1: Food Intake and Weight Monitoring Device Suite</h4>
<p>This device suite is intended to use multiple tools together as a kit to help dogs stay within a healthy weight range (Figure 1). The first part is a smart food bowl with a sensor that detects and recognizes which dog reaches the bowl. It, then, provides that dog the amount of dog food set by the user in advance and notifies the user about it via a mobile application (Task 5 &amp; 6). The second part is a 3D model of a dog’s body shape built by the app with the pictures of the dog taken by the user. Then, it conducts an actual &amp; ideal body shape comparison analysis based on the 3D model and other data like dog breed and age in the application (Task 4). The last part is a smart scale that weighs a dog and sends weight-related data, such as weight and body fat, to the application (Task 1).</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Figure 1: Design 1 - Food Intake and Weight Monitoring Device Suite</p>
<h4 id="design-2-pure-manual-entry-application">Design 2: Pure Manual Entry Application</h4>
<p>Unlike the first design, this design focuses purely on the application and manual entry of data. Users need to manually input different kinds of data for collection and analysis. This allows pet owners to be more precise with their tracking. Based on the sketches below, the users will need to manually input data, such as the number of steps walked, the amount of calories eaten, to track and monitor their dogs’ food intake and exercise (Task 1, 3, 4). The user will also be able to manually locate a nearby pet clinic and seek professional help (Task 2).</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Figure 2: Design 2 - Pure Manual Entry Application</p>
<h4 id="design-3-dog-camera-wearable">Design 3: Dog Camera Wearable</h4>
<p>This design, unlike the second one, is all automatic. This is also different from the second design, which is an all-in-one design that only comes with a camera wearable and a mobile application. This is more convenient than the other two. The camera wearable works like a goPro and enables the user to check whether the dog’s eating when it’s not supposed to (Task 5 &amp; 6). In the application, the user can view the automatically collected exercise and food intake data (Task 3 &amp; 6). The data and clips of the dog can be sent to a vet for consultation (Task 2).</p>

<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboard">Selected Design and Storyboard:</h3>
<p>After considering the feedback we received for the design sketches and  re-evaluating our user needs, we decide to narrow the scope down and focus on a mobile application, a smart collar clip that includes a proximity sensor, GPS tracking, and a pedometer, and an optional tile sticker. Based on our interview responses, tracking food intake and exercise is crucial to help dogs maintain healthy weight. The smart clip is enough to accomplish these two main tasks. It tracks different exercise-related data. Meanwhile, it replaces the smart food bowl by tracking which dog is eating via the clip’s proximity sensor detecting the other sensor sticker on the food bowl. The collar clip doesn’t only simplify the process of collecting and analyzing data, but also reduces the cost for users.</p>
<h4 id="written-scenarios">Written Scenarios</h4>
<h4 id="track-which-dog-ate-from-the-food-bowl">Track which dog ate from the food bowl</h4>
<p>Tom recently graduated from the University of Washington and decided to start a professional career straight out of school. He has two dogs, Sled and Gabi. Sled was found as a stray and is a Husky crossbreed, and Gabi is a 2-year-old Australian Shepherd. They live in a one-story house with a fair amount of extended family. Tom regularly takes his dogs out for exercise and plays with them. He also brings them to the veterinarian for a check-up every three months. He feeds both dogs once a day. However, Gabi and Sled have different eating habits. Sled likes to eat everything at once and has his bowl put away, while Gabi likes to graze bit by bit and has her bowl left out throughout the day. Sled likes to steal food from Gabi’s bowl. He’s overweight because he eats way too much every day. Tom wants to know whether Sled has eaten Gabi’s food while he’s not home so he would not give him anymore treats when he gets home. Therefore, he purchased Feedo. Soon, he received the smart collar clip and the tile stickers and downloaded the app Feedo. Tom synced the collar to the application and put the tile stickers on the two food bowls. Now, when he’s not home, the application will receive a signal from the clip if Sled gets close to Gabi’s bowl and notify him about the situation. When Tom is notified, he would not give any more treats to Sled when he gets home. After using Feedo for a while, he found out that Sled likes to steal food most of the time, so he reduced the amount of food for Sled and added more food for Gabi. Now, both Gabi and Sled are eating the appropriate amount of food every day.</p>

<h4 id="track-and-monitor-a-dog-s-exercise">Track and monitor a dog’s exercise</h4>
<p>Drew is a first-year mid-career graduate student in the information management program at Cornell University. He is so busy going to school and work at the same time. He’s overwhelmed by the amount of work he needs to do every day. He lives in an apartment with his one-year-old Poodle, Joba. Taking Joba out for a walk is the only time he has for relaxation. During this time, he only wants to enjoy his leisure time and usually forgets to track the distance walked or the exact time spent, even if he is concerned about Jobabeing a little bit overweight. He would like to increase the intensity of exercise for Joba, but he doesn't know how much he should increase. One day, he was searching online for means to help dogs lose weight via exercise. He came across Feedo and purchased it right away. He received a smart collar clip and a proximity sensor the next day after his purchase. He downloaded the application as well. Now, when he takes Joba out for a walk, the smart clip’s GPS tracking and pedometer would detect it and sends a message through the application to confirm with Drew about whether he’s walking Joba. Once Drew confirms it, the clip will automatically record the distance walked, the time spent, the speed, and the approximate calories burnt. When they get home, the application will send a summary of the exercise for analysis. With the application’s pop-out confirmation, Drew never forgets to record the exercise-related data now. Also, by viewing the collected data, Drew now has a better idea of how much to increase the intensity of exercise for Joba.</p>

<ng-template #designresearch_fridgigotchi>
<h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>
<p>In the United States, food waste is as prevalent as it is ecologically and economically damaging. The USDA estimates that between 30 and 40 percent of the food supply in America is wasted, equivalent to 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food annually. That is 133 billion pounds of food that could have been used to feed the hungry and $161 billion in unnecessary spending for consumers. Additionally, methane released from wasted food represents 6.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that isn’t even counting the emissions created from producing, transporting, and storing wasted food. Taken altogether, food waste is clearly a major issue in both the U.S. and internationally, and measures to reduce food waste would have benefits both ecologically and economically.</p>
<h3 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h3>
<p>To combat food waste we present Fridgigotchi, a refrigerator attachment that tracks food and helps people use their food before it spoils, all with a fun and cute Tamagotchi-like design. Fridgigotchi works by scanning either barcodes or receipts of recently purchased food and keeping track of estimated expiration dates. A screen would then display how close to spoiling each item is with “health bars” that lower as the food approaches spoilage. Fridgigotchi also recommends recipes based on the scanned food, aiming to get the food used well before it ends up in a landfill. As foods approach spoilage, Fridgigotchi starts to look sadder like an uncared for Tamagotchi, only looking happy again when the food has been used. We hope that this design inspires people to reduce food waste by gently encouraging them to use their perishables and warning them about spoilage well before it occurs.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-plans-and-goals">Design Research Plans and Goals</h3>
<p>Our focus with this project is to help people eat more sustainably, whatever form that might take. That could mean guiding people to more sustainably produced products in grocery stores, helping restaurant owners find ingredients from nearby farms or any other project that would help people help the planet with their food choices.To narrow down our project scope, we intend to interview an expert on sustainable eating to learn where we could have the most impact. Such an expert can likely be found within the UW sustainability network, and can be contacted through the department or their university email. We also want to see if we can assist restaurants in becoming more sustainable, so we plan to interview an owner of a restaurant that prides itself on sustainability to see how they what their approach is, and what improvements could be made. Broadfork, Cafe Flora, and Portage Bay are just a few of the local restaurants with good sustainability reputations that we could contact for interviews. Lastly, we suspect that the way to reach the most people would be through the grocery store, so we also intend to observe how a typical grocery store shopper decides what food to buy through contextual inquiry.
Through the Design Research, our goal is to explore potential problems in food waste, sustainable eating and understand how we could drive people toward sustainable eating in the participants’ perspective.  We try to understand the expert’s, restaurant owner’s and grocery shopper’s sustainable eating habits and experience.</p>
<h4 id="design-research-methods">Design Research Methods</h4>
<p>Since our goal focuses on eliciting information, exploring potential problems and narrowing down our scope, we choose interview as the primary method in our Design Research. In contrast, methods such as surveys would not be as helpful here as interview because they are more anonymous and restrict participants to a subset of predetermined answer options. Our method is primarily to conduct interviews with experts in sustainable eating, restaurant owners as well as grocery shoppers. We wrote a specific interview script with detailed questions we follow, conducted, recorded the interviews and took notes. In the interview script, we had two subsets of questions where one set of them is demographic about their background and another set is primary regarding our topic in sustainable eating. The first one with Amanda went very effectively and we learned a lot from the interview, so we decided to continue the interview approach with the rest of our participants. Each of them we had a different interview script and questions centering around the participants’ background and our goals for that participant.</p>
<h4 id="design-research-participants">Design Research Participants</h4>
<p>Based on the plan, we interviewed three participants including Amanda as the expert in the field, Beth as the sustainable restaurant owner and Betty as the grocery shopper.</p>
<h5 id="-amanda">“Amanda”</h5>
<p>Amanda is a student studying environmental science at UW that we interviewed in person on campus. She was definitely an expert in the field, an intern for 21 Acres (a center for sustainable agriculture in Washington), and involved in the sustainability community. We interviewed Amanda to get an expert opinion on the most important aspects of eating sustainably, as well as to get a sense of someone on a budget approaches sustainable buying and eating habits.</p>
<h5 id="-beth">“Beth”</h5>
<p>Beth is the head chef at Terra Plata, a Seattle restaurant with a significant focus on sustainability. We conducted an interview with her over the phone, with the goal of figuring out what an eco-minded restaurateur prioritizes when both buying produce and creating a menu.</p>
<h5 id="-betty">“Betty”</h5>
<p>Betty is a UW student living in Lander who does not normally consider sustainability when making decisions around food, but is interested to learn more about sustainable eating. We conducted an interview with her face-to-face, with a focus on finding out what kinds of sustainable eating habits that she felt were the most achievable.</p>
<h4 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h4>
<p>After conducting our interviews we were able to significantly narrow down our project scope.  The overall problem of sustainable eating was able to be broken down into four main pain points: consuming too much red meat, not buying food locally, not buying food in season, and wasting food.  Since our target audience is young people, we wanted to focus on problems that would have a low barrier of entry.  Buying food in season and reducing food waste were both problems that, when solved, would also benefit individuals making the behavior change (by costing them less money), so we decided to investigate those further.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing red meat consumption.</strong> One of the first things Amanda did to eat more sustainably was to cut red meat out of her diet. She told us that is by far the most consuming form of produce by far, and our own research has since borne that out. Red meat is responsible for 10 to 40 times as many greenhouse gasses as vegetarian produce, with cows in particular being responsible for up to 20% of all methane production. Unfortunately, we also found that getting people to reduce their red meat consumption to be largely infeasible. Beth, who puts a strong focus on sustainably sourcing her restaurant, still put burgers on her menu because she needed them to attract a wider base of eaters. Betty similarly said that going off of red meat would not be a lifestyle change she would be willing to make.</p>
<p><strong>Buying food locally and in season.</strong> One of the major things that we learned from participants is that buying food locally in season is one of the preferred and easier practices for them to be more sustainable. Because buying locally and eating in season does not significantly require much change in people’s eating habits. Moreover, we learned from Amanda that food transporting from other regions and countries, and food out of season(requires special temperature and light) contributes greatly to the carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing food waste.</strong> Beth described reducing food waste as the primary way she tries to stay sustainable. She said that she tries to use every part of every ingredient she buys so that none of it goes to waste. She also keeps a close eye on the leftovers that come back to her kitchen, actively adjusting the portion sizes of her dishes to minimize how much her food gets thrown out. Wasted food is responsible for 6.7% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions2, so this is indeed an important way to improve our food sustainability. Betty also said that reducing food waste would be the lifestyle change she would be the most willing to make, which tells us that there is perhaps a better market for designs in this theme than the other two.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Based on our design research, we decided on six tasks that we felt our design should strive to handle. The tasks themselves are bold.</p>
<p><strong>Figuring out what needs to be discarded.</strong> Based on the research, we learned that one problem with food waste is that expiry dates are often conservative. Many foods can still be consumed after their expiration date, but not everyone knows this, so they may end up throwing away perfectly good food.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing food with others.</strong> In the interviews, our expert and shopper both mentioned that they sometimes share food with their roommates before it goes bad, so we felt that making sharing food easier would be a good way to reduce food waste. Thus, because of its effectiveness and convenience for people to practice, we identify this task.</p>
<p><strong>Buying produce in season.</strong> The chef in particular said that she prioritized buying food produce that is in season above all else when deciding what ingredients to stock. This is both more sustainable as well as more cost effective. Moreover, we learned from Amanda that food out of season(requires special temperature and light) contributes greatly to the carbon emissions.
Because of how effective it is for promoting sustainability and the convenience for people to practice based on our research, we identify this task.</p>
<p><strong>Check and remember food expiration dates.</strong>  Based on our research, we learned a common trend that almost all participants often forget to check on their food, and food is often found spoiled too late. Thus, almost all participants want to solve this problem. Because of how common the problem is and the strong desire for people to change, we identify this task.</p>
<p><strong>Using food before it spoils.</strong> Betty mentioned that she sometimes forgets what she has in the fridge until it's too late, so actively encouraging people to use their food before it spoils seemed like a good way to prevent this. This also aligns with our goal of the “check and remember food expiration dates” task so we identify the task.</p>
<p><strong>Figuring out what to buy while at the grocery store and buying the right amount of food.</strong> Based on our research, we learned that one important way to reduce food waste is to not have too much food in the first place. This would likely mean getting people to be judicious when figuring out what and how much to get at the grocery store.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-smartphone-app">Design 1: Smartphone App</h4>
<p>This design is an awesome app that helps reduce food waste, increases sustainability awareness and supports various functions. First, users could input their food data at home --- either by manually entering the product, scanning the barcode or by ML image recognition. After having all the available data and the exact expiration date, to prevent waste, the app reminds users (through notification)  when their food is about to expire (customizable). In addition to avoiding food waste, the app allows users to share any unused and extra food with others through social media. What’s more, the app gives users recommendations for similar in-season food when the food they are looking at buying is out-of-season.</p>

<h4 id="design-2-smart-fridge-with-fridgigotchi">Design 2: Smart Fridge with “Fridgigotchi”</h4>
<p>The idea behind the smart fridge is to keep track of what is currently in the refrigerator and use that to make suggestions for groceries or recipies. Sensors would track how full the fridge is (pressure sensors on each shelf) and what is going bad (gas sensors). The fridge would also be able to scan barcodes to more precisely know what it contains. The smart fridge would also have a large interactive screen display that can be used to get information about the food. A calendar to show estimated time to expiration, grocery suggestions based on what has been in the fridge in the past, and suggestions for recipes based on what is in the fridge now would all be display options. A fun, tamagotchi-like display (“Fridgigotchi”) would also be used to show what is going bad and should be eaten now.</p>

<h4 id="design-3-grocery-store-kiosk">Design 3: Grocery Store Kiosk</h4>
<p>This design is a smart grocery kiosk that promotes sustainability, minimizes food waste and provides customers with interesting information of relevant food data. The kiosk also contains the users’ previous purchase information and data. With this user data, the user can put their food in the kiosk to scan.  The kiosk will remind them if they just bought the same food a few days ago and give users a moment to reflect on if they actually need the food. In addition, by scanning the food, the kiosk provides information about this food such as what period of time in a year this kind of food is in season and how far it traveled to get to the store. What is more, with this rich user data, the kiosk can make suggestions based on the user’s purchasing habits.</p>

<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<h4 id="why-we-selected-this-design">Why We Selected this Design</h4>
<p>We decided to move forward with the Fridgigotchi design because we like the physical aspect of the smart fridge and the cute aspect of Fridgigotchi. We got feedback such as the fact that you cannot always see food spoiling, so it is good to have some sort of visual indicator.  Another comment was that portraying food like Tamagotchis is effective because the emotion related to seeing animate objects suffer will drive people to take action, rather than just seeing their food as inanimate objects.  We are interested in exploring the lifelike aspect of food since this is something that seems to be relatively unexplored, compared to smartphone apps on reducing food waste.  We think that creating a more emotional connection with the food will help motivate people to pay more attention to the food in their fridge.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-1">Scenario 1:</h4>
<p>John is living on his own for the first time and is learning how to manage the food in his fridge.  Since he often spontaneously goes out to eat, leftovers and groceries often sit in his fridge, rotting, without him noticing.  John realizes that he has been wasting a lot of food by letting it spoil, so he invests in a Fridgigotchi.  Since Fridgigotchi is displayed prominently on John’s fridge, he can “see” what is going on in his fridge simply by entering the kitchen.  John can see when Fridgigotchi is suffering.  Even when John does not know what is in his fridge, Fridgigotchi does, so it shows him what needs to be discarded, so John can safely discard the right foods.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard_1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="scenario-2">Scenario 2:</h4>
<p>John ends up throwing away a lot of food because his fridge is often a random assortment of ingredients he does not quite know what to do with.  These random foods often end up getting thrown out because John does not know how to combine them into anything useful.  John invests in a Fridgigotchi to help him.  Fridgigotchi tells John what foods are about to expire and suggests recipes for how to use different combinations of them.

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>Our design uses concepts from <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">this paper</app-generated-link> as a model for the stages of getting out of an abusive relationship, namely the labeling of the <em>physical control</em>, <em>escape</em>, and <em>life apart</em> phases of such a relationship. The specific problem we are tackling is bridging the information gap between the abuser and the survivor. It is all too common for an abuser to cut their partner off from help and certain information sources and/or to have some sort of surveilance strategy in order to effectively exercise their control. We look to provide the survivor with some of the information they are lacking in order to help empower them to feel confident enough in their knowledge of the situation to begin to find ways out of it. Our specific focus is on network related information asymmetry, such as if an abuser is monitoring network activity as a tool in their control strategy.</p>
<p>The way we propose to do this is to have an internet connected HUB device that can be connected to a network that will monitor network activity <em>without contributing</em> to said network activity. The possibility of creating such a device that can monitor a network without speaking over it is the central assumption we have made in our design. The other assumption is that such a device could not be easily tampered with or reprogrammed, such as if an abuser managed to get their hands on it and tried to turn it into another tool they can use. The information collected by this device could be presented to the user via some client app or website to help inform decisions they make in their relationship, particularly as it pertains to how their network activity is being tracked.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>From the onset, we employed <em>value sensitive design</em> principles, with our primary focuses being <em>privacy</em> and <em>security</em>. The goal of our design research was to gain insight into what specific difficulties survivors face when trying to get out of an abusive relationship so we could narrow down on one big but specific problem we could design for.</p>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of our problem space, we did not want to try to reach out to actual survivors of Intimate Partner Abuse (IPA) as we felt putting people in that situation wouldn't be fair to them. Initially, we read anonymous posts on online forums from survivors, which gave us some examples of the types of situations and ways in things could go wrong that we needed to consider in our design. We also read the aforementioned <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">paper</app-generated-link> as part of our design research. At this point we were also trying to make meetings with counselors on/near campus, hoping to interview them. We had no success in doing so. With the information we had at this point, we started making some designs.</p>
<p>We later had the opportunity to have a video call with one of the authors of the <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">paper</app-generated-link>. We went into the call with the mindset of it being a semi-structured interview. We already had some designs forming and some ideas for what we could do to help survivors of IPA, and we wanted to see which ideas made sense to someone who knew far more than us on the subject and which problems made no sense. The call ended up helping us to greatly narrow the scope of our design, which at the time was still far too broad and non-specific.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<p>The insights gained from each element of our design research helped to progressively narrow our scope down until we were down to a point that felt specific enough without being too small to produce a full design around.</p>
<p>The forum posts helped us cut out certain initial brainstorming ideas that made no sense or would be far too difficult to implement successfully.</p>
<p>The <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">paper</app-generated-link> provided our design some structure as we had a model with which to think of the process of getting out of an abusive relationship. It also provided more technology-specific insights into what design considerations made no real sense or, again, would be too difficult to implement correctly while accounting for all the nuance and individuality of each situation.</p>
<p>The video call with the author of the paper was pivotal in narrowing the scope of our design onto one specific problem that we could address fully. It was from this call that we narrowed down on designing for bridging the information gap between the abuser and the survivor. Previously we had been designing more for helping the survivor through the <em>escape</em> and <em>life apart</em> phases. Switching the focus to bridging the information gap also shifted which part of the process we were designing for. We are designing for transitioning from the <em>physical control</em> to <em>escape</em> phases.</p>
<p>One of the main takeaways of all our design research was that no one solution can solve every problem in our problem space. Our first designs had elements meant to assist with <em>escape</em> and <em>life apart</em>, while also tackling a task that had to do with transitioning from <em>physical control</em> to <em>escape</em>. We were trying to do too much and not devoting enough attention to any one of the problems we were considering. Once we narrowed our scope, we felt much happier with the direction the design was headed and much more confident in our ability to tackle the problem and produce a viable design solution. The more narrow scope also helped us understand what type of end-user we would be designing for, helping us also to apply some of the broader insights we gained from the earlier forum searches and from the <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025875">paper</app-generated-link> itself.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Our initial 6 tasks for the 3 first design ideas we had were as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Ultimate Secure Login</li>
<li>Total and Immediate Data Deletion</li>
<li>Remote Local Data Transfer from One Device To Another</li>
<li>Compile an Escape Plan</li>
<li>Obtain Relevant Information to Local Resources</li>
<li>Access Log of Login Attempts With Information About What Device has Attempted to Login</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of our far-too-broad designs was to provide the user one secure, private, and centralized location in which to keep all their <em>escape</em> and <em>life apart</em> related plans. Privacy and security were central to many of the tasks we initially chose. We needed a very secure login process for this reason. We wanted data storage to be local so that it wouldn't exist anywhere except on the device it was being used. The data deletion and transfer were for emergency situations where the end user may not feel safe. The login attempt log was meant to inform potential data deletions if they user felt they were being tracked. We put a lot of thought into how to leave no trace of our solution's presence on the user's device in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>After we significantly narrowed our scope and modified our design, the two central tasks we designed for were as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the constant feed of network activity</li>
<li>Perform a cybersecurity analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>The network activity feed helps inform the user of how their network is being utilized, helping inform decisions on how and when to use the network the HUB device is connected to. Since we are assuming the device collects the information without being directly tracked by the network as it is doing is, this is a safe operation. The feed provides the user with information they would not otherwise have, and such information could assist them in forming a plan of how begin to wrangle free of the abuser's control.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity analysis gives advice where the network feed does not. It uses the data being collected by the HUB device to evaluate the safety of the network it is related to and make suggestions on how to improve cybersecurity. This could, for example, suggest that a user don't use their home network for anything related to getting out of their relationship and instead do such searching at a public place, like a library, where it cannot be tracked.</p>
<p>The internet could be a very valuable tool for survivors, but when they don't know how safe it is to use they can feel powerless to find a way out of an abusive relationship. These tasks help provide survivors with more information so they can know how to go about finding a way out of their situation.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<p>Our first three designs were created and sketched before the video call, so they are quite different from the design we ended up going with. Here's a very brief overview of each design and what considerations went into them.</p>
<h4 id="design-1">Design 1:</h4>
<p>The first design was focused on the <em>escape</em> phase and had the home screen as its central focus. The home screen linked directly to the tasks this design considered, making it quick and easy to access each of them after login. The primary focus of this design was the Escape Plan portion and the other tasks directly or indirectly contributed to the use of the Escape Plan. This design was meant to give the user one central place to store any <em>escape</em> and <em>life apart</em> planning related information.</p>

</div>
<h4 id="design-2">Design 2:</h4>
<p>The second design was centrally focused on being discrete and unassuming. It displayed a personalized interactive image, where certain gestures would perform the various tasks in this design, including the login process. Here we were exploring how to make it as difficult as possible for someone to even attempt to take control of the information in the app.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Design 2"></p>
<h4 id="design-3">Design 3:</h4>
<p>The third design shares the most similarities with our final design choice. This design was focused on device interaction logging and cybersecurity. The goal was to provide the user information about how their account was being accessed and make recommendation based off of this information.</p>
<p>Each of these three designs specifically addressed the login process, as safety and privacy are important values to consider for our design. We were always considering how to keep the artifact from getting into the wrong hands.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>After the video call and our decision to focus in on bridging the information gap between abuser and survivor, we knew we wanted to essentially take our &quot;interaction log&quot; task and blow that up into a full design of its own. In considering how to get more useful information than just login attempt information, we came up with the idea for the IoT HUB device that could be on a network. The device would collect network acticvity information for all devices on the network. We knew we had to make the aforementioned assumptions regarding its ability to collect information without contributing to network activity in relaying that information to the user for the design to work. With our assumptions made, we considered how to use the data the device would collect to present useful information to the user. From this, we came up with the two primary tasks of our design.</p>
<h4 id="checking-devices-interaction-log">Checking Devices Interaction Log</h4>
<p>Here, Joan uses the interaction log to understand the strange behavior in the IoT devices in her household. Joan could use the information to disable the devices' internet connectivity, or to replace the devices altogether to limit her abuser's opportunities to access any of Joan's network information. The information is presented to Joan in a way that is easy for her to understand so that she can make an informed decision in how to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>Since the data collected on the network is not limited to smart devices, the interaction log can also be used to understand some of the network behavior of more commonly used devices like desktops, laptops, and cell phones. This information can be used to make informed decisions on how to utilize the network that the HUB device is connected to.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/story1_1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Storyboard 1"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/story1_2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Storyboard 1"></p>
<h4 id="performing-cybersecurity-analysis">Performing Cybersecurity Analysis</h4>
<p>Here, the cybersecurity analysis is performed to find malicious activity on the network from the abuser's hacking attempts. The data from the HUB device is used to evaluate the security conditions of Joan's network, warning her of someone's attempts to hack in. Joan's response is to change her passwords, which can save her accounts being accessed by her abuser as he tries to regain control of Joan.</p>
<p>In an alternative example, one could use the cybersecurity analysis to receive recommendations on whether or not the HUB's network is safe to use freely or if there is another device on the network tracking activity. This type of information can be empowering for a survivor to take a step in the direction of getting out of their situation if they can be made aware of where they're free to use the internet without fear of being tracked or surveilled by their abuser.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/story2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="Storyboard 2"></p>
<p>Overall, our design looks to provide the end user with information about their network and cybersecurity that it may otherwise be difficult to obtain. Through this infomration, one may feel empowered in their understanding of their situation, leading them begin to find a way out of it.</p>

TODO: It would be nice to have a place to put their tagline
productivity with intention
--> 
<p>Today, people seem to be more attached to their smartphone than ever before. Their work life, social life, and down time appear to all revolve around one device which has instant access to all of the world’s collective information. However, instead of using their phone as a productive tool, many people seem to have an unhealthy relationship with their device. We wanted to get to the root of this relationship and understand why phones aren’t being used to maximize different areas of people’s lives to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>Through our research, we found that students and working professionals often found themselves unaware of the time that they spent on their phone and that they weren’t consciously choosing what they wanted to do on their phones. That’s why we created mode: a productivity app that helps you both actively and passively manage your screen-time in a way that works for you. Mode helps to keep you aware of the time you’re spending on your device through a plant on the home screen that grows as you continue to use your phone in a healthy way. Mode also lets you switch between work and play functionality, which restricts which apps you can access at any given time, allowing you to be fully intentional with the way you use your phone.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>We decided to format our design research as a combination of interviews and informal diary study. The interview was structured to have three different stages: perception, revelation, and reflection. For the first stage of the interview, we asked participants questions about their current phone usage. In the next stage we had our participants take out theirs phones and navigate to their personal Screen Time data, which was then followed by the final stage, which was about absorbing and reflecting upon that data. We asked participants to gauge the differences between their perceived phone usage and their raw data and reflect upon that difference.</p>
<p>This interview structure was important in that it allowed us to better understand the possible problems that arise when people are confronted with the data that either supports or rejects their perception of reality in regard to phone usage.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/participants.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>We contacted a college student, a graduate student, and a young working professional to conduct our research. Phone usage isn't a problem restricted to one age group and we wanted to explore multiple occupations to see different problems.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<p>After we conducted the research, we compared our participants' perceived phone usage and their actual usage. Also, we documented their reflection on the difference between perceived and actual usage. Our participants also mentioned their concern about their current behavior and what they are looking forward to as a potential solution to help them. The followings are the key findings we have:</p>
<p><strong>Balance Between Work and Leisure Activities</strong></p>
<p>Our first participant, the college student, sought the balance between work and leisure activities, Aa there is no clear boundary between class/work and personal life for her. However, the graduate student and the working professional actively exercised this balance.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Awareness Regarding Phone Screen Time</strong></p>
<p>In the majority of our users, we found a disconnect between their perceived and actual usage of their phone. For the most part, users underestimated their usage and we’re surprised to see the amount of time they spent on their phone.
Partial versus complete restriction of phone
Our users also mentioned that when they sought to restrict their usage, they didn’t want to lock their whole phone down. Rather, they needed to restrict access to certain apps that they found distracting, while leaving others available.</p>
<p><strong>Subconscious Scrolling on Social Media</strong></p>
<p>Finally, our users found themselves constantly scrolling through different feeds on their phone. In particular, our college student was shocked by the amount of time she spent on a single social media app throughout the week.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Throughout our design research, we observed what our participants did to enhance their productivity with their phone. Moreover, we discovered concern regarding their phone usage. We came up with six tasks that our participants perform that reflect our findings:</p>
<p><strong>1. Being Present in the Moment When With Family and Friends</strong></p>
<p>Our participants turned off their phone and notification, so they can enjoy the moment with their family.</p>
<p><strong>2. Blocking Notifications After Work and Before Bedtime</strong></p>
<p>With an increasing ability to communicate with their friend, our participants felt anxious about the bombarding messages throughout the day and decided to turn off the notification.</p>
<p><strong>3. Using Phone for Work Productivity</strong></p>
<p>Our participants use Slack, Messenger, Canvas, and email to communicate with their co-workers.</p>
<p><strong>4. Browsing Phone for Extended Periods of Time</strong></p>
<p>Some of our participants are not aware of their actual usage of their phone, and they are surprised by how much more usage they spent a day than they estimated.</p>
<p><strong>5. Limiting Time on Certain Social Media Apps</strong></p>
<p>Realizing that they spent too much time of the social media apps, our participants decided to completely disable their apps during work hours.</p>
<p><strong>6. Using a Smartphone in Place of Computer</strong></p>
<p>As a product manager, one of our participants used her phone as the primary tool to communicate with her team when she is commuting.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<p><strong>Design 1: Modes</strong></p>
<p>This design focuses on partitioning your phone into two different modes: social and work. These modes are activated by a notification that appears only on the lock screen, forcing the user to commit to the activity that they want to use the phone for. After unlocking the phone, depending on the mode chosen, different apps will show up on your home screen. In work mode, only apps related to things such as email, business messaging, and schoolwork will show up on the home screen. In social mode, only apps related to social media, gaming, and entertainment will show up on the home screen. There will be presets for which mode each app fits in, but ultimately, the user can decide which app they want in each mode.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><strong>Design 2: Social</strong></p>
<p>This design is implemented as an application that limits functionality of users' phones to let them be present in the moment while tracking the overall phone usage of everyone. In this application, the home screen shows different groups that the user is in. Before a specific group decides to hang out in person, the group members can send a &quot;Request Lockout&quot;. If everyone agrees with the lockout, their phone functionality will be limited according to their set goals during a specific period of time. For example, if the users plan to decrease usage on Instagram, Facebook, and games to encourage in-person communication, the lockout will block those apps for two hours when they are hanging out. Clicking a group, the user can see the group members' overall usage of different categories of apps throughout the week. When the user clicks on a category of app in the pie chart, it will show individual usage of different members.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><strong>Design 3: Plant Visual</strong></p>
<p>This design will act as a passive way of notifying the user about their phone usage by displaying a plant in the user’s home screen. When the user is spending too much time on their phone, the plant wilts. Conversely, when the user spends less time on their phone, the plant will grow. If the user spends too many days beyond their limit, the plant will die. Some statistics will be shown along with the plant like how long the current plant has been kept alive, the total number of plants killed and the longest time a single plant is kept alive. Users can also set which apps support or diminish plant health in their settings, tailoring limits to their particular usage.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design3.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>We ultimately decided to move forward with a combination of two of our designs:</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/venn.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>For the work and play modes we want an active way for users to intentionally switch between modes when they want to take a break and relax or sit down to focus on their work. With the plant, we have a passive way to visually indicate time usage. Despite most phones having graphs and charts of time usage, we found that our participants did not look at their data despite knowing about the functionality. The plant growth will be mapped to goals that a user sets for themselves. If they wish to spend less time on an app, the plant will decay faster when using that app and if they wish to spend more time on an app, the plant will grow accordingly. We find it very important that the user has the ability to set their own limits and apps to their personal needs.</p>
<p><strong>Storyboard 1:</strong></p>
<p>Mark is about to head into work, but sees that he’s been using his phone all morning and his plant is dying. To prevent distraction, he puts his phone into work mode and gets to work. During his lunch break, he switches his phone back to normal and sees that his plant has grown while he’s been productive.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><strong>Storyboard 2:</strong></p>
<p>Our second storyboard focuses on how people can limit time on certain social media apps. During bedtime, Sarah is scrolling through Instagram and unknowingly spends more than two hours on her phone. Moving to her home screen, she notices that her plant is beginning to wilt so she consciously puts down her phone and opens up a book instead.</p>

Capture life as it happens
--> 
<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview:</h3>
<p>Taking photos is a convenient and effective way of keeping a record of the past scenes in our lives.  However, sometimes being in a rush on either a road or business trip, it is hard to find time to take a picture of every moment one might want to capture. And it is even harder to keep in mind every detail one might want to remember. But if we cannot recall the stories behind the pictures afterwards, those photos may have already lost much of its meaning.
Our solution is a wearable camera that can be attached to any clothes or hat. Pictures can be taken by a voice command or click of a button. For users who want to capture every moment without their intervention, auto capture is an option. The audio record feature helps to save all the details behind the lens of a camera. Pictures are shared with a phone, where they are organized into trips or searched by a keyword.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants:</h3>
<p>Our design research initially focused on gathering data about the process of taking notes for photos. We used semi-structured interviews and tried to interview a variety of demographics. After interviewing our first candidate, we reflected on the primary use case for our app and decided that travel might be a slightly more focused design space to explore. This decision was driven in large part due to the current apps and processes that are already entrenched in many people’s photo arsenals. Our first interviewee had a very specific workflow using Instagram and Snapchat, and we felt that it would be exceedingly difficult to create a product that could be inserted into daily usage alongside these popular apps. With a specific area to focus on, we constructed questions to digest how photos play into how people currently travel. Since the major focus for our project was about helping to capture memories, a big portion of our interview was very functional in exploring the storytelling and reflecting process. The rest of our interview questions focused on pinpointing the pain points that currently exist when taking lots of photos in a short time period, as happens while travelling.</p>
<p>We targeted both men and women to interview. Our age range was mostly targeted at the young adults. Although our product is focused on aiding memory, we decided against creating something specifically for the elderly as we felt many older people don’t take many photos compared to the younger generation. We specifically looked to interview people that had gone on a trip in the distant past (over two years prior) to see how well they could recall the trip through looking at their photos.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes:</h3>
<p>We had several ideas about potential directions heading into our interviews. Many of our initial ideas were somewhat polarizing. Since photos are such an intimate form of communication, our interviewees had varying levels of comfort regarding privacy. There were, however, several key themes that held true through all of our interviewees.</p>
<p>When asked about journaling or taking notes to assist in memory, many of our interviewees expressed that taking notes for photos requires too much effort. Most expressed that they had the desire to record more than just what they had photos of. Despite this, none of the candidates even considered journaling as a viable option due to the effort and level of commitment required. When prompted, several interviewees indicated that they would prefer to take notes on the spot, and would likely support a voice memo concept that enables lightweight and instant note-taking.</p>
<p>When asked why they took photos, interviewees brought up that photos are often used to convey a story. Although some photos were shared on social media, the majority of photos were often taken to piece together a narrative of the whole trip to share with friends and family. Many photos were taken to help illustrate interesting or funny stories encountered along the trip, an example being a grocery store selling a whole chicken in a box in Malaysia. The same interviewee also seemed to recall certain information only after reflecting on his photos. He had to be prompted about the sequence of the photos to remember additional details about the trip such as the timing of certain events and small interactions that weren’t photo-worthy. We decided that the usage of photos in conveying a story should be a core focus since most current photo taking apps largely emphasize the photos rather than the circumstances around the photos.</p>
<p>Almost all interviewees had some group photos/photos taken with others. Our interviewees indicated that group photos are always shared with members of the photo. They indicated that group photos are a great way to remember a shared experience, and that the photo is as much for everyone else included in the picture as it is for themselves. Sharing photos can oftentimes be somewhat of a hassle purely due to the extra steps it takes after taking photos, but our interviewees still found it important enough to put in the extra effort. Thus, we viewed the sharing of photos as an essential process that provided an opportunity for streamlining.</p>
<p>Among nearly all interviewees, one major pain point in dealing with photos is that searching for specific photos can be time consuming. One interviewee tried searching for photos from their Cambodia trip, but could not find them readily because the photos were grouped by city instead of by country. There were also times when an interviewee would tell a story and try to find the corresponding photo. We took this as a sign that we could implement a better way to search, potentially including the personal context of a photo as a searchable field.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Taking photos.</p>
<p>Pictures can be taken with just a simple voice command or a click of a button. Settings will also allow users to choose how often pictures to be taken and what kind of signal to be used (if any).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding descriptions to photos.</p>
<p>Users add voice memos right at the moment when a photo is taken. Then, the application will have an option to play the recording, or automatically transcribe it and add as text notes and keywords to the photo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Searching for specific photos.</p>
<p>Custom keywords and tags are added to each photo. The application will allow users to do a  search for a photo not only by location or date, but also via advanced and personalized keywords.</p>

<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches:</h3>
<p>We came up with three different designs to address the problems we have learnt from the users. Each design focuses on a different use case and a set of tasks that the user can perform. Our first design is a travel photo management app that mainly addresses the pain points of existing camera and album apps, to make it more convenient and efficient for users to manage their travel photos. However, since we realized that there are also some inconveniences for people to even take photos when traveling, we came up with our second design - a wearable mini camera, to enable people to capture their travel moments more easily. Moreover, when analyzing our user research results, we found out that some user problems are specific to group travel scenarios. Therefore, we also designed an app to specifically enhance the group travel experience.</p>
<h4 id="design-1-travel-photo-management-app">Design 1 - Travel Photo Management App</h4>
<p>The first design is a mobile app focused on the improvement of existing mobile camera and album applications. It enables a few tasks that the users wish they could perform, including capturing stories, organizing, sharing and searching for photos. Users can record a voice memo when taking photos and the app will automatically transcribe it to a textual description of the photo. Users can then share the photos and the descriptions to others in a story format. Having the descriptions, the app allows more specific search function based on the keywords in photo descriptions. Moreover, the app can suggest blurred and duplicate photos to users for deletion.</p>

<h4 id="design-2-wearable-mini-camera">Design 2 - Wearable Mini Camera</h4>
<p>The wearable mini camera is a portable camera that can be attached to any model of glasses or pinned to the clothes. It is as lightweight and un-intrusive as possible to attach to any item of clothing, targeted for any user who wants to capture a photo without breaking a moment. Users can interact with the camera through buttons on the camera or voice command in order to take photos or record voice descriptions of the photo. The photos and voice memos are automatically transmitted to a mobile app, which allows users to manage or share the photos.</p>

<h4 id="design-3-group-travel-enhancement-app">Design 3 - Group Travel Enhancement App</h4>
<p>This travel enhancement app is targeted at groups travelling together, with the primary goal of making group travel as painless as possible. In this app, multiple users can specify that they will travel together, forming a travel group. Within this travel group, photos will be automatically shared among members, and suggestions for future itinerary will be offered to each user based on past travel history.</p>

<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards:</h3>
<p>We have chosen to further develop our Wearable Mini Camera design. Based on our user research, we found out that people have various needs and pain points in different stages of the photo taking and management process. Reflecting on our initial goal of helping people remember more precious moments, we decided to focus on the “upstream” problem first, which is to enable people to capture more photos and stories easily when traveling. Together with the camera, we also want to design a mobile app, which stores all the good photos taken by the camera, and provides some essential functions in our first design for people to easily manage their photos.</p>

<h3 id="problem-solution">Problem &amp; Solution</h3>
<p>In the United States, up to 40% - or around 70 million tons - of food produced is wasted, costing around $220 billion a year. For the average 4-person family, this costs them around $1500 per year. Globally, food waste is around 33%, with more developed countries having higher percentages of food wasted.</p>
<p>Food waste in the U.S. is an important issue because of its impact on our economy and the environment. Besides being expensive in terms of opportunity cost, there are further environmental impacts due to depletion of land agriculture, natural resources, and freshwater supplies. In addition, rotting food in landfills is a major source of methane emissions, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change at about 30 times the potency as carbon dioxide. Lastly, wasted food results in a smaller food supply, raising costs for consumers. Because food is necessary for survival and generally regarded as a human right, excessive food waste can contribute to the poor and disadvantaged being denied the right to feed themselves.</p>
<p>Current solutions exist to reduce or prevent food waste, but they address different stages of the farm-to-table process. Companies like Misfits Market, Imperfect Produce, and Hungry Harvest ship “ugly produce&quot; that are rejected from supermarkets directly to consumers to minimize wasted produce. Smart fridges are also used to automatically track personal inventory, but these are often impractical and expensive, costing over $2000 for a new appliance that is usually already present in most people’s homes.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smartfridge.jpeg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-participants">Design Research: Goals, Methods, Participants</h3>
<p>We conducted our design research with the goal of understanding specific grocery shopping habits of our various participants, focusing in particular on discovering which habits led to wasted food for each individual. Because our problem spanned a range of populations -- essentially any household that utilizes a fridge -- our research focused on how individual habits uniquely contributed to each individual’s food waste.</p>
<p>To encapsulate the largest span of this diverse population, our participants included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jim (pseudonym):</strong> A college student living in a small shared household, shares a fridge and mostly shops for individual groceries</li>
<li><strong>Sam (pseudonym):</strong> A college student living in a large shared household, shares a fridge and mostly shops for individual groceries</li>
<li><strong>Jody (pseudonym):</strong> A mom of a family of five, shopping and cooking for the whole family</li>
<li><strong>Lily (pseudonym):</strong> A college student living in a single studio apartment, shopping and cooking for themselves without sharing any groceries</li>
</ul>
<p>By capturing a diversity of household sizes and who the participants are shopping for, we hoped to maximize the variation in responses and discover a greater range of grocery habits.</p>
<p>We initially started with contextual inquiries to understand each participant’s spending habits, in particular seeking out what tradeoffs participants made when deciding which groceries to purchase. After observing participants one and two while grocery shopping, though, we learned that the physical grocery store environment had little impact on their eventual shopping habits, and so we instead turned to interviews for participants three and four.</p>
<p>Lastly, in addition to these interviews and observations, we asked participants to log diary entries of their food waste over a period of about five days; the goal of these logs were to identify how a specific shopping habit might lead to a certain amount or type of food wasted. In the end, these diary logs did not provide much insight into patterns of food waste in large part due to the short period of time, but also because many individuals were already fairly aware and conscious of wasting food.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research: Results and Themes</h3>
<p>Following our design research, we realized that despite the variety of participants involved in our research, they each identified the same main challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Difficulty keeping track food items:</strong> All of our participants mentioned difficulties in tracking what food items they currently had at home. Jody would frequently call her kids to ask what was in the fridge, and Jim would stop in the middle of the grocery store to think back to what he could remember seeing in his fridge. This meant that participants would end up forgetting to repurchase items that they ran out of, or end up with too many items that they rarely used: Jody specifically mentioned that they had three bags of brown sugar because since she rarely used it, she would forget that they already had enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowing how to use up food:</strong> As a follow-up to the difficulties in tracking their current foods, participants also discussed how they would struggle to think of ways to use up the foods they had. Much of their new grocery purchases would be dependent on how to create new meals that would use up their leftover food items, and so the challenge of using up foods involves both meal ideation, as well as tracking how much of what food item they still had for these new meals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of planning before grocery shopping:</strong> As both students and working adults, all the participants rarely planned their grocery shopping ahead of time: they would fit in a stop at the store whenever and wherever they could. This lack of planning contributed to their difficulty in keeping track of their groceries, and so we knew our design would need to be efficient and convenient to integrate into their existing lifestyle and grocery shopping practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Awareness of their food waste:</strong> Lastly, each participant was already aware of their food waste, and wanted to avoid unnecessarily throwing away food items. Jim explicitly cited that Trader Joe’s excessive plastic packaging bothered him, and Sam mentioned her own preference towards environmentally-friendly produce (e.g. locally-sourced and organic). This meant that our problem and proposed solution to minimize food waste was desired by our population, and that individuals would be interested in more effective ways to practice better habits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These insights were realized mostly from the interviews and contextual inquiry, as we asked specifically about what their goals were while grocery shopping and how they managed their food items. Although the diary logs were interesting to understand how much food was wasted for each participant, it did not help us to identify specific patterns or trends that led to wasted food.</p>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<p>Although each participant went about their grocery shopping differently than the others, they all shared tasks that were common practice regardless of where they shopped, or what their goals were while grocery shopping.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 1: Keeping track of current groceries at home</strong></p>
<p>Having an inventory of groceries at home is important so that users do not buy excess amounts of a food item. Our participants usually called a friend or family member at home to coordinate their shopping trips.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 2: Choosing new groceries to incorporate with current groceries</strong></p>
<p>Part of the difficulty of using up extra food is finding ways to prepare it in different ways. During shopping trips, participants reported trying to find new ingredients that could be prepared with old ingredients in order to use up existing inventory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 3: Measuring shelf life of foods and how long it will take to consume items</strong></p>
<p>Shelf lives vary based on food, and it is difficult to tell if a food item is close to going bad besides using smell/appearance, which is impractical for large inventories. Our participants stated that they forgot about what was expiring sometimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 4: Clearing out foods that have gone bad</strong></p>
<p>Clearing foods that have gone bad requires being able to track which foods have gone bad. Being able to measure shelf life of foods would also help track which foods have gone bad and thus allow participants to clear these food items out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 5: Sharing excess food to prevent wasting food and money</strong></p>
<p>Sharing food that is about to go bad allows less food to be wasted. Participants in non-family shared households wanted to borrow their roommates’ food at times and were willing to share their own excess food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Task 6: Prioritizing fresh produce that participants want</strong></p>
<p>Individuals want to be able to find the products they eat all the time, but there is never a reliable way to know what stores will have what they want. Often-times, they never go home with the groceries they intend to purchase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-sketches">Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-organization-and-food-storage">Design 1: Organization and Food Storage</h4>
<p>This first design utilizes a basket or placemat design that users could place into their fridge to organize their food items by category. These baskets and placemats would track the item’s mass over time, and allow users to check in real-time exactly what food item they had at that exact moment, and also display their food waste trends, utilizing a mobile app to display this information. Additionally, it could provide possible recipes based on the exact food and amount they had available to them in their fridge.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch1a.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch1b.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch1d.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-2-digital-grocery-list">Design 2: Digital Grocery List</h4>
<p>This design utilizes a mobile app that would allow users to track their groceries and know exactly when each item was purchased. Users could take a picture of their receipt after grocery shopping, and the app would digitize their receipt, knowing exactly what was purchased and on what day. It would also have a “food friend&quot; feature where you could add friends that also used the app, and indicate which of your foods are shared and see which of their foods are shared. This compiles a holistic grocery inventory based on your purchases, as well as what other items are shared for you to use. Thus, users could know exactly what was available to them and when they were purchased.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch2.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-3-food-waste-tracker">Design 3: Food Waste Tracker</h4>
<p>This mobile app addresses the tail end of groceries by tracking how old foods are, and highlighting which items are expiring soon. It would prompt you whenever foods are expiring soon or have already gone bad, as determined by the expected expiration date, sending a notification to prompt you to clean out your food. It would also provide visualizations for users to see their exact food waste trends by week or month, as well as a “month in review&quot; to see how much of what was wasted.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch3a.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch3b.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/sketch3c.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-storyboards">Selected Design &amp; Storyboards</h3>
<p>Overall, the most practical design we chose that could accommodate the tasks we listed was a mobile app (combining both grocery recording and expiry date tracking features from designs 1 and 3). An app provided more flexibility in recording and analyzing data than an individual device like the placemats in design 2. Additionally, users would be able to coordinate grocery shopping trips with their inventory at home just by using their phone, which many participants already use to either record their grocery list or call home to double check items. Thus, a mobile app was the most easy to integrate into the participants’ everyday lifestyle.</p>
<h4 id="storyboard-1">Storyboard 1</h4>
<p>A shopper goes about their usual grocery routine, purchasing items they would usually buy during each trip. Instead of trying to recall what they still have at home or calling someone to check their fridge and pantry, the shopper can refer to their phone as they walk through the store themselves. They can check for when the last time they purchased a certain grocery item, and use this to decide what items they will need to repurchase or what else they can buy to supplement their current items. After checking out, they can take a photo of their receipt and the app will record all the new items purchased on that trip, updating the purchase date and predicted expiration dates.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="storyboard-2">Storyboard 2</h4>
<p>As foods get old and their expiration date approaches, the mobile app will send a notification to remind individuals about these items. It can then offer ways of disposing the food as well as the food’s packaging, and they can see how much of food they have thrown away over time. As the app is used more and more, it can suggest more optimal purchase amounts for each food item that is thrown away.</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>In today’s society, many quantify personal success with awards and achievements instead of happiness and health. Such a mindset causes people to prioritize their work over all else, and many people neglect both their physical and mental health - according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, “1 in 5 U.S. adults experience mental illness each year” [1]. Bullet journaling is an existing method for people to manage their schedules or thoughts, and focuses on improving efficiency and mindfulness. However, it is inconvenient, time-consuming, and intimidating. It currently exists as a physical form where people can spend hours designing their journal spreads, only to abandon them after infrequent use. The online journaling community can also be intimidating for those with limited art experience, as many journalists use social media to share their extravagant spreads.</p>
<p>Our proposed solution, Pocket Planner, transforms bullet journaling into a hybrid digital and physical experience with a smart journal and an app. This maintains the same efficiency as bullet journaling but removes the restriction of a paper journal, making it portable and convenient. By providing people with semi-automated tracking, clear data visualization, and different methods to record their emotions, Pocket Planner can personalize bullet journaling to make it more efficient, empowering, and accessible to all.</p>
<p>[1] <em>National Alliance on Mental Illness, “Mental Health By The Numbers”, 2019. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">https://www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-by-the-numbers.</span> Accessed: 14-Feb-2020</em></p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>We conducted our design research through semi-structured interviews with people who currently journal or used to journal but quit, diary studies with people who do not journal at all, and contextual inquiries with people who used to journal but have adapted their methods. Our goal was to understand how people viewed bullet journaling and how they practiced self-reflection and daily planning.</p>
<p>Each research method helped us narrow down our tasks and exposed both important and inconvenient aspects of bullet journaling. Our contextual inquiry showed that a paper journal forces people to flip back and forth while transferring information between pages. The diary studies indicated how people with limited experience with tracking and journaling approached the idea of bullet journaling. Our interview participants also modified their journaling methods over the years to suit their own schedules and comfort levels. Understanding participant perspectives regarding the hardships of a physical journal while still acknowledging the importance of a tactile experience helped us refine our thinking and approach.</p>
<h3 id="stakeholders-and-participants">Stakeholders and Participants</h3>
<h4 id="semi-structured-interviews-and-contextual-inquiries">Semi-Structured Interviews and Contextual Inquiries</h4>
<p><strong>Participant 1:</strong> We conducted a semi-structured interview with Cathy, a 27-year-old woman who retired 2 years ago and is now a stay-at-home mother. She used to journal but it was too time-consuming, so she switched to using a pre-printed planner. Writing things down helps her stay organized, but paper planners are not portable. Cathy believes bullet journaling with others can help her stay accountable and motivated.</p>
<p><strong>Participant 2:</strong> We conducted a semi-structured interview with Betty, a 22-year-old masters student at UW who uses Google Sheets to manage her tasks. She likes the customization and synchronization of an electronic form, since she can access her journal across different platforms. Betty would like a journal that displays statistical data, such as how many steps she takes or how many books she has read.</p>
<p><strong>Participant 3:</strong> We conducted a semi-structured interview and contextual inquiry with Jane, a 24-year-old tax accountant intern and graduate student at SU. She used to design her own journal templates, but now uses a pre-printed planner to save time. Writing notes on paper helps her actively register information. Jane tracks her weekly schedule to prevent herself from getting overwhelmed. During the contextual inquiry, she frequently flipped back and forth while transferring events between spreads.</p>
<p><strong>Participant 4:</strong> We conducted a semi-structured interview with Abby, a 19-year-old undergraduate at UW studying architectural design. She has bullet journaled for over 5 years to track her tasks, mood, and activities. Her bullet journaling has evolved from intricate monthly spreads to practical daily entries, which has helped relieve her anxiety. She enjoys writing or doodling with pens and paper, but thinks that digital journals are more convenient.</p>
<h4 id="diary-studies">Diary Studies</h4>
<p>We designed a bullet journal template to conduct diary studies with five people who did not bullet journal before. Most of them already had their own methods for planning, such as Google Calendar or paper planners. During the diary studies, our participants barely filled out the trackers because they forgot to use their journals, left them at home, or did not find any reason to write anything down.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<h4 id="summary-of-key-findings">Summary of Key Findings</h4>
<p>While we initially considered converting the entire experience of bullet journaling to a digital form for greater accessibility and efficiency, we decided to maintain a physical aspect in our design based on our research findings. We found that the inconvenience of daily tracking was a major reason why people quit journaling, which encouraged us to consider alternate methods of interacting with the journal.</p>
<h4 id="common-themes">Common Themes</h4>
<p><strong>People rarely have the motivation to self-track.</strong>
According to our design research, most participants forget to mark their trackers and end up abandoning them. It is difficult for participants to reflect when trackers are separate from the rest of their spreads, and must be manually updated on a daily basis. Jane (Participant 3) incorporated mindfulness into her scheduling by dividing her workload across multiple days. This theme shows us that we should focus on adapting bullet journals and methods of interacting with them to encourage mindfulness on a daily basis, and incorporate an automated system to collect tracking data to inform people about their progress towards habits and goals.</p>
<p><strong>People lack convenient access to their notes.</strong>
One of the core ideas of bullet journaling is that it serves as a centralized organization tool. This has proven to be effective for practicing mindfulness for both Cathy (Participant 1) and Jane (Participant 3), as they can see all of their plans in one place. However, Cathy, Betty (Participant 2), and Abby (Participant 4) also hoped to have more convenient access to their journals, envisioning a digital version of their journals for on-the-go scenarios which can be accessed without a physical planner. We also realized that having a digital form can prevent flipping back and forth between pages. This theme shows us that our design should provide a digital version for convenient access when physical planners are not with users or are impractical to use.</p>
<p><strong>People find the action of physically writing to be helpful.</strong>
Three participants stated that writing down their to-do lists and schedules on paper is helpful. Cathy (Participant 1) noted that writing notes helped her stay organized and be realistic while assigning tasks for herself, while Jane (Participant 3) mentioned how writing helps her register information in her brain and retain more about her schedule. Abby (Participant 4) explained how the act of writing helps relieve her stress and anxiety. This theme shows us that having a tactile experience can give people a designated space to be more intentional with their thoughts and tasks, helping them slow down and reflect upon their day.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>From our research, we were able to identify six primary tasks. Bullet journaling already incorporates the idea of tracking habits, writing tasks or thoughts, and accessing all items in one place, and we decided to explore making these tasks digitized. In addition, our participants indicated that joining a supportive community, having visualization and graphs for their trackers, and developing more ways to journal would all keep them more accountable to journaling on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Track daily activities, goals, and habits to monitor or develop.</strong>
Tracking helps people maintain healthy habits and activities, and it can even motivate them to develop a new one. Manual tracking is difficult to stick with and discourages those who do not have experience, as noted by Cathy (Participant 1). To make habit tracking less of a chore, we are adapting our journal design to incorporate an semi-automated tracking system. This data, collected and reported for a variety of user-entered goals, can inform participants about their progress towards their habits.</p>
<p><strong>Visit a platform to gain inspiration from other journalists.</strong>
With the rise of social media, people can usually find a community to encourage and motivate them to pursue an activity. Cathy (Participant 1) mentioned that journaling with others might encourage her to restart and stay accountable. We are focusing on having a platform where participants can encourage and support each other, as well as gain inspiration by learning from other journalists’ experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Be intentional with your tasks by writing them down.</strong>
Three of our interview participants stated that writing down their to-do lists and schedules on paper was helpful; they found the act of writing to be therapeutic. Writing and visualizing schedules also helps people retain more information and be realistic with the tasks they have, so they can avoid overbooking themselves. Therefore, we are keeping the idea of a physical journal, as the act of writing can encourage mindfulness and relieve stress.</p>
<p><strong>Record and transcribe verbal reflections or conversations for quicker journaling.</strong>
While writing down tasks and goals promote mindfulness when developing schedules, writing diary entries can be difficult. People often spend time talking about their days with friends, but there is no way to capture those memories with a bullet journal. To reduce the overhead for reflecting upon one’s mood, we are adding the ability to record and transcribe verbal reflections. This empowers participants to communicate their emotions to others and makes bullet journaling more accessible to participants in the blind or visually impaired community.</p>
<p><strong>Visualize statistical data of plans, habits, or goals.</strong>
Two of our diary study participants did not see the virtue of tracking their goals or habits and they lacked the motivation to track and practice self-reflection in their lives. We hope to encourage tracking and reflection on a daily basis to promote overall mindfulness. While traditional trackers can be hard to understand, simple graphs of the data can make it easier and quicker for participants to understand their progress. We are creating journals that can visualize a person’s statistical data based on their automated tracking data and their written tasks to help them adhere to their plans, habits, or goals.</p>
<p><strong>Access all planning and organizational tools in one place across multiple devices.</strong>
While bullet journals are intended to be a centralized organization tool, our design research showed that people wish for more convenient access to their journals when they do not have their physical planners. Adding a digital component makes journaling much more feasible, especially for people with busy schedules. We hope to expand upon the idea of having all planning and organizational information in one place by making the data accessible on all digital platforms.</p>

<p>We combined the ideas presented in the Smart Journal (Design 1) and app (Design 2) sketches to determine our design direction, and our focused tasks are taking time to be mindful and writing down tasks and thoughts (Task 3) and accessing organizational tools everywhere and across multiple devices (Task 6).</p>
<p>We chose a hybrid design, a smart journal that is compatible with a multi-platform app. This provides people with efficiency and convenience while still allowing for a tactile experience and interaction. Our research participants emphasized the importance of writing things down, but also mentioned the significant overhead required for tracking and staying motivated to achieve their goals. A physical form allows people to slow down and visualize their schedules, making it easier to say no to commitments they cannot take on. Especially with many journalists facing busy schedules, we hope to reduce the amount of procedural and mindless tasks that are often associated with tracking, to both encourage participants to find time to practice mindfulness in their routines, and to make journaling accessible on any platform. We hope that our Pocket Planner design will empower people to be more mindful of their mental health.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<p>A recent study by <app-generated-link linkHREF="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7jx6z631">UC Berkeley</app-generated-link> showed that if one additional passenger was added to every 10 vehicles, 0.8 to 0.82 billion gallons of fuel could be saved annually in the U.S. This would also amount to a reduction of 7.2 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, facilitating carpools is not only a step in reducing the impact of climate change but also has numerous positive benefits for individual citizens such as cost savings and reduced traffic congestion.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Our solution comes in the form of an application that is centered on providing its users with a safe and convenient way to find suitable people to carpool with. Our research shows that there was an interest in finding both routine and one-off carpools as long as safety and convenience was prioritized. Our design will feature a matching system that factors in background checks and user ratings to ensure safety. Its focus will be to allow users to build a reliable network of people to carpool with as well as easily organize carpools with existing contacts.</p>
<h3 id="design-research">Design Research</h3>
<h4 id="goal">Goal</h4>
<p>As carpooling is a fairly common activity across all populations, we wanted to explore the different contexts of carpooling with a focus on user’s current transport experience, previous carpool relationships and what factors they consider the most important with regards to carpooling</p>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<p>We used two methods, semi structured interviews and an online survey, to gather concrete findings for the direction of our design.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-Structured Interviews</strong></p>
<p>We chose to use semi-structured interviews as our primary method for conducting our research. This involved a thirty minute interview with participants which loosely followed a framework of questions centered around our focus. This gave us flexibility in asking follow up questions to explore the specifics around each participant’s context.</p>
<p><em>Interview Participants</em></p>
<p>Our participants were students and working professionals as they would be the most likely to have routine commutes. We wanted feedback from people who do not drive to ask questions about their concerns with finding someone to carpool.  We also wanted feedback from people with their own cars to ask about their concerns with sharing their car. Our specific participant backgrounds were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A working professional employed at the Columbia Tower in Downtown Seattle who buses to work</li>
<li>A working professional employed in a small clinic in Shoreline who drives to work</li>
<li>A university student who carpooled in highschool while living with a host family in Florida, where public transportation is not available.</li>
<li>A local university student who drives to school by herself</li>
<li>A working professional that bikes to and from work every day</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Online Survey</strong></p>
<p>The goal with our online survey was to gather feedback from a wide variety of contexts that we could not cover with our interviews. Our survey questions covered the same themes as our interviews but also allowed us to ask direct questions, such as whether they would be interested in our concept, without any biases due to the anonymous nature of our survey.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-themes">Design Research Results &amp; Themes</h3>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/surveyresults.png" width="100%" style="float: right; max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This tree graph shows the survey participants’ responses when asked about their three most important factors in carpooling. Highlighted in green are the four most common keywords: cost, friendliness, safety, and convenience. Through these results and the findings from the semi-structured interviews, we were able to develop two main focuses in our carpooling design.</p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h4 id="safety">Safety</h4>
<p>Almost every participant in our design research study brought up safety as their main concern towards carpooling. The survey results showed that they were interested in having background checks and features like reviews and ratings to help ensure a thorough screening for each member in the carpooling community. Four of the five participants in the semi-structured interviews also suggested allowing users to choose their own preferences for their fellow carpoolers in order to set mutual understandings of the expectations they have towards each other. For example, one of the university students suggested drivers should clarify if smoking or eating in the car is allowed, and passengers can suggest extra compensation for missing or late drivers. In general, most wanted the ability to modify their own carpooling communities and avoid riding with strangers whenever possible. This increases the likelihood that the carpooling group have common interests and friendly, non-awkward conversations through this customized filtering process.</p>
<h4 id="coordination">Coordination</h4>
<p>The most frequently mentioned issue from our participants was the lack of proper coordination within the carpooling group. The participants from both research methods wanted live updates and locations of their drivers and a clear itinerary for the entire ride. In addition, scheduling was a major factor in this problem. Two of the working professionals in the semi-structured interviews explained that they do not want anyone in the group to have to wait or to adjust their schedules in order to create the carpool. They wanted some flexibility that is required for their work, especially for the clinic worker who needs to be at her workplace according to her patients’ needs. However, if it was not too inconvenient for everyone in the group, they are more than happy to carpool in order to save money and gas.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p><strong>Finding carpoolers with the same route</strong>. This task is focused on ensuring that people are actually willing to carpool together. Almost all cases of carpooling that our participants partook in were when the carpoolers had a similar or identical destination. Intuitively, it is hard to motivate people to carpool if they must go out of their way to pick others up. As such, making sure the routes of the carpoolers are compatible is a high priority for our design.</p>
<p><strong>Communicating the location and status of the carpool</strong>. This task was motivated by the participants indicating that scheduling and waiting for transportation were major pain points for them. This issue exists in other forms of transportation as well, such as public transit, shuttle buses, and rideshare services. Thus, we want our design to minimize the amount of waiting done by the carpoolers.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the most efficient routes</strong>. Several participants mentioned they had difficulty coordinating carpools with multiple passengers, which involve several pick-up and drop-off locations. A design that can find the most efficient route will help alleviate this barrier.</p>
<p><strong>Finding a community with shared preferences</strong>. Our participants had many different preferences when it came to carpooling. Cleanliness, driving speed, and talkativity are some examples of factors people consider when carpooling with others. By matching carpoolers that share similar preferences, we increase the chance of people will carpool together again in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring driving behaviors to ensure the safety of carpoolers</strong>. Safety was a chief concern among the vast majority of our participants, and we wanted our design to give people peace of mind when carpooling.</p>
<p><strong>Seeing money/C02 emissions saved from carpooling</strong>. The practical benefits of carpooling was a main motivating for many of our participants. For instance, one university student we interviewed mentioned they carpooled to reduce parking costs. By clearly showing these benefits to people, we can motivate them to carpool more frequently.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-finding-new-people-to-carpool-with">Design 1: Finding New People to Carpool With</h4>
<p>The focus of this design is to help users find reliable people to carpool with. When adding a carpool, a user can choose their destination, set their schedule and edit their preferences. They will then be given a list of possible users that match their route, schedule, and preferences. Each match will be displayed as a profile with their description, driver rating, route, and preferences on a card. The user can choose to send a request to the carpool to the match. If the recipient of the request accepts then they can communicate with each other in a chat. New users can also be added to the group if approved by both parties. The user’s profile page also includes a summary of how much money they have saved through carpooling in comparison to driving solo as well as how much they have reduced their carbon emissions to motivate further carpooling.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/3design_find_people.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-2-gamification">Design 2: Gamification</h4>
<p>This design is centered around gamification and creating a competitive environment to encourage people to carpool more frequently. The design will feature a way to create and join groups, which can be based on this such as workplace, city, etc. The groups will have a leaderboard of people that have participated the most in carpooling. This grouping will allow people to find others that share something in common with them, which would help expand a person’s network of people to carpool with. The design also features a statistics page for people to track various carpooling stats, as well as a badge system for reaching certain achievements.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/3design_gamification.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-3-connected-car-service">Design 3: Connected Car Service</h4>
<p>This designed platform is intended for the duration of the riding experience, which assumes that the carpooling group has already formed. By inputting the addresses of each passenger’s pick up point, it can determine the best way to arrange the pick-up points for the most efficient routes. It also allows for easy access to directions on the road and communication to passengers. This is particularly important in situations when there are unexpected delays or schedule changes while on the road. Moreover, It includes the ‘Passengers’ feature for specific passenger information. To facilitate the in-car activities, the “Music” feature allows all passengers to add their own choice of music onto the music queue in the car through their own devices.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/3design_incar.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>In the end, we chose to pursue our first design centered around “finding and matching individuals”. Matching passengers and drivers that share the same preferences provide a feeling of safety and comfort, which is a feature that is desired by an overwhelming number of our research participants. By allowing users to provide feedback for their past trips, whether it be by ratings, reviews, or other methods, it informs other users about people they are going to ride with. Moreover, many participants see heavy traffic and missing bus schedules as pain points of their current transportation method, which is another main focus of our first design, helping users communicate a reliable yet flexible schedule and provide timely updates.</p>
<p>Some problems that we found with the “gamification design” are that it focused too heavily on routine carpools around a specific community, and not as much on one-off events, or for small friend groups.  It also assumes that there is a community or group that the user is already interested in joining, and does not help with finding or matching individuals. Our main concern for the “in-car experience design” is the lack of focus for this aspect of carpooling during user research. This results in not having as much time or information to help direct our design. However, we believe that there are elements of these designs that we can incorporate in our main design. For example, features like badge/achievement will help motivating users to carpool more frequently. With the in-car design, we can think of screens and interfaces that can make the actual carpooling experience better.</p>
<h4 id="task-1-finding-suitable-carpoolers">Task 1 - Finding Suitable Carpoolers</h4>
<p>Our user research overwhelmingly showed that people wanted to know their carpooling group first before the carpooling experience. Rather than random strangers, they would like to have a network of reliable passengers through filtering or background checks for security. When asked the most important factor when deciding to carpool with someone, almost every participant mentioned “comfortability with other passengers”, “relationship”, and “reliability”. This is why we chose to center around this task based on finding suitable carpoolers. When the user creates an account, they will be asked to fill out their preferences for people they would like to carpool with. Then based on their preferences and schedules, they will then be able to find recommended carpoolers that share the same preferences. For example, the system will not match a rider who often eats in the car with a driver who cares a lot about their car’s cleanliness.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="task-2-communicating-live-updates">Task 2 - Communicating Live Updates</h4>
<p>Most of our research participants mentioned that delays and unexpected scheduling changes were the main problems with their carpooling experiences. We wanted to make sure this is included in our design as our targeted participants of students and working professionals mentioned that schedule changes and road-related delays were common. Before a trip starts, the driver will receive a personalizable notification regarding the start time of the carpool. When the driver starts to drive, the riders then will be able to receive notification regarding the current location of the driver and the estimated arrival time. Based on their settings, they will also be able to receive multiple notifications/messages regarding the trip status. In the best situation, all users will then be able to arrive on time. This task is especially useful in emergent cases, such as lateness, heavy traffic etc. By allowing the users to see the drivers/rider’s location and keep updating, this design helps facilitate communication and avoid conflicts.</p>

<h3 id="id-1-problem-and-solution-overview">1. Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>There exists an implicit onboarding process in specialized fields of work. Not only is there a standard training process for new employees, there is a second, hidden one as well. This hidden process is the understanding of technical jargon in that field, especially in professional contexts. Our problem is how do we speed up this process, or, in other words, how do we get people to master sophisticated and specialized jargons and information in professional industries at a quicker pace. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 176,000 jobs every month in 2019. The expanding workforce and relentless onboarding that occurs for professionals exacerbates this problem.</p>
<p>Our solution to the problem lies in utilizing continuous speech capture technology. People can track their own speech as well as those of their colleagues to better understand technical jargon and integrate it into their own speech. The solution is a wearable app pair: There is a feature on a smartwatch paired with a smartphone app. The primary purpose of the wearable is for speech capture when prompted, and the smartphone app offers insights, analysis, and ways to improve their vernacular, both through understanding new words and eventually using those words in their specialized field.</p>
<h3 id="id-2-design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">2. Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>The focus of our design research was on gaining a deeper understanding of what conversational issues people new to a certain professional environment face, and what they do to overcome it, so that we can use continuous speech capture to assist with the process.</p>
<p>We considered many different approaches to carry out or research, ultimately deciding to conduct interviews. This made sense because it allowed us to provide participants with a safe environment to articulate and comfortably discuss the problems they face on a daily basis in natural language, a highly personal topic.</p>
<p>Our design should be versatile enough so that it can be used by people in any profession, regardless of their niche. In other words, we want to be able to help not only beginner computer scientists, but also amateur plumbers. In an effort to cover this wide spectrum, we decided to interview an art student, a lawyer, a biology student, and a business student.</p>
<p>Initially, we were also concerned about technical communication across different languages, for example a German-speaking and Hindi-speaking mathematician trying to communicate at some conference, and finding a solution for that as well. However, after the first couple interviews, we discovered that this wasn’t a big problem, a finding supported by a lot of our secondary research, and so pivoted away from trying to solve any translational problems.</p>
<h3 id="id-3-design-research-results-and-themes">3. Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<p>Despite the vastly different background of each research participant, many common needs and practices came up, allowing us to critically breakdown and identify common opportunities. A fundamental pain point for everyone was the difficulty they faced in understanding the technical lingo of an environment they were new to, and expanding their knowledge base, and then subsequently incorporating all of this in their own speech.</p>
<p><strong>People initially had trouble comprehending the sophisticated jargon unique to their specific environment.</strong> A young art student spoke about the challenges she faced, saying &quot;There are literally thousands of different technical adjectives in art, and you have to know exactly how each one is different from another while critiquing, which really caused me problems when I was a newbie artist.&quot; Similar frustrations were expressed by all our participants.</p>
<p><strong>The issue of collecting new information from intellectual discussions with peers in their respective fields was also universally expressed across all our participants.</strong> &quot;Very often, in meetings with my boss, I would still be fully processing something he said earlier, and so miss out on some crucial information he said later on&quot;, exasperated the business student.</p>
<p><strong>The process of incorporating technical lingo consistently in your own everyday speech is rather slow.</strong> Even after our participants felt like they got the hang of the workplace vernacular, their own speech was still not professional enough by some standards, and had room for improvement. &quot;It took me awhile to start using technical words and ideas in the lab confidently, and in the correct context. The process was slow, and in hindsight, I wish I had some help speeding it up&quot;. This desire to 'sound smart' in front of their peers was similarly expressed across all our interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, people were also seemingly curious about similarities and differences in their speech among different settings of daily conversation.</strong> &quot;I would love to gain a better understanding of how I talk differently at work and at home. What are the things I say to clients, and what are the things I say to my grandma. I wonder if there are some specific words I use a lot in some situations but not in others.&quot; said the lawyer we interviewed. A similar curiosity was found even in some other participants.
These were the results that came out of our design research process.</p>
<h3 id="id-4-identified-tasks">4. Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>We have summarized main pain points that were mentioned during interviews with our potential targets as well as from our initial design research. After analyzing our research and interview results, we designed 6 tasks that embody the objectives our targets want to accomplish and particular needs they have.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1: Identify and compile new terms and vocabulary.</strong> Four interviewees all expressed their concerns to quickly comprehend and extract important terms in fast-paced intellectual discussions. Hence, we think it is fairly important to design this task to help our potential target identify and organize new terms and vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2: Review and study identified vocabulary.</strong> The majority of our interviewees, when being asked about memorizing new terms and keywords, told us that they have to force themselves to review and memorize them constantly, otherwise they will quickly forget those words completely.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3: Integrate vocabulary into daily conversations.</strong> Although all of our interviewees acknowledged that remembering and integrating newly-gathered information into their speech is a natural process, they worried that the entire process is too slow to be practical without any external forces. They also identified that they constantly find it difficult to naturally incorporate those words to appropriate contexts when talking with other professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4: Identify places for improvements.</strong> In our design research, we noticed that a lot of our interviewees, even though they have spent time reviewing and extracting important information, they always lack a clear goal to enhance and hone their skills, not sure where they are and where they are heading to. This makes their effort less effective and leaves it in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5: Reflect on changes and progress.</strong>  Through our design research, we discovered that incentivizing and personalizing learning experience triggers powerful human emotions, particularly fulfillment, encouragement and interests. Reinforcing good behaviors and improvements by offering small, staged rewards, even small psychological rewards, can help users accomplish their goals one by one and create a sense of achievement for them to proceed further. According to the statistics demonstrated by TalentLMS [1], 81% of respondents said that the reward system increases their engagement and gives them encouragement for future learning.</p>
<p><strong>Task 6: Draw connections among different settings of daily conversations</strong>. Throughout our interviews with our potential target users, we noticed that people have particular need to &quot;translate&quot; speeches in their professional areas to speeches aiming for people without professional knowledge. As our interviewees mentioned, every time before conversations, they need to spend a long time thinking carefully about how to use plain language to properly communicate in front of people outside their industry but always fail to achieve this by unconsciously assuming other people understand what he/she is talking about with professional languages.</p>
<h3 id="id-5-proposed-design-sketches">5. Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<p><strong>Design 1: Wearable - Mobile Learning App Pair</strong></p>
<p>This wearable-mobile app pair especially focuses on collecting new information from conversations and learning the newly-gathered information.Learners can tap the record button on the wearable screen to start recording and stop the recording by tapping again. The recording will then be analyzed, jargons from this field will be presented in a manner that is easy to comprehend and memorize, integrating methods such as relational diagrams, flashcards and quizzes. Meaning, frequency of the words mentioned, and common usage will be presented if one clicks the word bubble. Playbacks of each word are also provided for the learner to get a sense of the context the new words are used. See <em>Figure.1</em> below for details.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 1: Wearable-Learning App Pair</b></p>
<p><strong>Design 2: Speech Improvement Mobile App</strong></p>
<p>The speech improvement mobile app is more focused on helping people learn how to use words in the correct context and tracking their every step along the speech improvement journey. The design of the app combines the idea of personal training apps and Grammarly. Users can build a profile, provide the information on their current fluency in their areas, and what they wish to achieve. A timeline will then be generated for the users to present a clear visualization of their speech improvement journey. The users can tap the record button on the lower menu to start recording. The written version of their speech will be presented on the speech, there will also be suggestions on some words or framing of sentences to make the speech more appropriate in the given context. The advice may come from the speech of professionals that the users talk to, or external sources. Details are given in <em>Figure.2</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 2: Speech Improvement Mobile App</b></p>
<p><strong>Design 3: Wearable and Audio Analysis on Desktop</strong></p>
<p>The wearable is specifically designed and equipped with audio recording capability. Users are able to proactively activate the audio recording by pressing the start button on the wearable and stop recording at any time by pressing the button again. The audio then will be sent to and analyzed on the registered PC or Mac securely. All related and emphasized topics will be extracted from the audio clips and listed on the front page by their frequency and importance. This allows users to quickly pinpoint the topic/area they want to review afterwards. Each topic includes a keyword list and a corresponding list of brief summaries according to the fields, realms that users select. By clicking the keyword, the user is able to review playbacks in which the keyword is mentioned as well as other tangible related materials.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 3: Wearable and Audio Analysis on Desktop</b></p>
<h3 id="id-6-selected-design-and-storyboards">6. Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>We chose to combine the second design and third design. Together, these two designs address a majority of goals we identified from our participants: pinpointing new terms and vocabularies, reviewing and getting familiarized with those new words/info and evaluating their progress. The combined design contains a wearable to support audio recording as well as a smartphone for data presentation. Smartphones make analysis and reflection on those captured data much easier, and wearable allows for a less intrusive method of continuous speech capture. From our design research, most of our participants tend to become rusty on certain words as time goes by. The combined design aims to facilitate learning and proactively reactive memory in the correct context.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Compiling New Terms/Vocabulary and Review the Identified Words</strong></p>
<p>Peter is a new lawyer, and the conferences and hearings he needs to attend are always lengthy. Even though there are always audio recordings, it is time-consuming to listen to the entire recording aimlessly to gather the most instructive information. He wants to quickly capture the keywords and juristic theories so that he is able to draw some parallels from them. After researching online, he decided to give Procabulary a shot. On the other day, he recorded the hearing that he attended using his smart watch. The material was then transferred to ProCabulary and analyzed thoroughly. A brief summary of the court hearing, and a list of extracted keywords were presented in the app. The order of the keyword list was based on the frequency those words were mentioned, and he can check out the definition, common usage, and playback audios of the mentioned keywords. Peter was glad that he discovered ProCabulary, for it could not only save him tons of time going through the lengthy recordings, but also help him capture those keywords with ease.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 4: Storyboard for Scenario 1</b></p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Identifying Places for Improvement and Track One’s Progress</strong></p>
<p>Jason is a Ph.D. student who majors in transportation engineering, but he wants to pursue a career in the consulting industry. As a non-native speaker, he finds the transition to be quite challenging. A friend highly recommended him try out ProCabulary to improve his speech, so he purchased the premium plan. He set up his profile, specifying his current fluency in consulting, and his goal (to sound like a professional consultant). The other day, Jason recorded the conversation with a client by using the recording app on his apple watch. What he said during the meeting was extracted and presented in ProCabulary. Several suggestions regarding his word choice were provided, for example, &quot;I'm available &quot; to be rephrased as &quot;I will have bandwidth to take on this project,&quot; and &quot;get the senior person engaged in my idea&quot; be replaced by &quot;gain traction.&quot; With the advice provided by ProCabulary, Jason's speech became more appropriate for the consulting setting. Jason was glad that he could find a tool that helps him incorporate the consulting glossary into his language.</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview:</h3>
<p>In general, people love to look back on memories and experiences whether it brings them a sense of joy and nostalgia, allows them to set goals for the future, or provides a way to process emotions. However, many times, reminiscing proactively seems difficult. Some people struggle to keep journals regularly and others feel like they do not reflect effectively.</p>
<p>The solution to these difficulties should allow for proactive, timely, and convenient forms of reminiscing. The intent is to allow users to get a beneficial experience no matter how much time they choose to dedicate to reflection. Additionally, users should have the choice of reminiscing with the forms they want, in the way they want, and at the time they want. Our design strives to achieve these goals by providing a web platform that acts as a scrapbook to combine physical and digital media of various forms to record a snapshot of one’s days and memories.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants:</h3>
<p>Our design research was conducted to help us understand how and why people reminisce and find any pain-points in the process. Some of the questions we focused on include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often do people journal?</li>
<li>What forms do people use to remember and reminisce?</li>
<li>What are the major pain points with journaling?</li>
<li>What do people like to remember?</li>
<li>What do people not like to remember?</li>
<li>Do people prefer physical or digital mediums for journaling?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our research methods included a survey and three interviews. We chose to conduct a survey because we thought it would give us a broader picture and show us general trends across a population of individuals who do and do not journal. Additionally, as the survey was released before the interviews, it helped us develop better interview questions. We posted the survey on several social media accounts in addition to sending it to peers and family. All responses were made anonymous unless the participant was willing to be contacted for a follow-up interview. Next, we interviewed three random participants at the UW Bookstore and the UW Allen Library. We decided that reminiscing is a fairly universal task and thus wanted to choose relatively random participants to both reflect that and to get a diverse set of opinions. Initially, we had also considered doing a diary study to learn more and test out different forms of journaling, namely free-form vs. prompted journaling. However, after analyzing our survey results, we found that people overwhelmingly prefered free-form journaling and that there could be privacy concerns with collecting participants' entries, so we decided not to proceed with the diary study.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes:</h3>
<p>In the survey, we received 30 responses, many from college students but also some from the age group 50 and up. The survey was beneficial for quantitative data and visualizing overall trends. One main take away was that the majority of participants have an interest in starting to journal or already journal. Additionally, participants like to reminisce prominently through digital media, like music, photos, and shared memories on social media. To quote one respondent,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I find music to be the most effective method as when listening to songs they take me back to very specific moments of my life”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, we found that the majority of people that do some form of journaling value the physical form of the journal for its authentic feeling, however, there were still those who prefer digital, for its convenience.</p>
<p>In our interviews we collected 3 unique opinions on reminiscing. The first two interviews were conducted at Allen Library. The first participant communicated that journaling felt like a daunting task. Thus, she reminisced through photos and reflective writing assignments from her coursework. She also mentioned that she would want to journal if it was easier. From the second participant, we learned that journaling in both physical and digital writing is useful; he used Microsoft Word and his physical journal for different tasks. For the final interview, we targeted the UW Bookstore’s diary and journal section in attempt to find a participant with direct interest in journaling. Our third participant used journaling as a form of goal-setting. He liked to make action items and goals from his daily reflections in his digital journal so he could act on those the next day.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks:</h3>
<p>To decide on our tasks we drew on insights from both the survey and the interviews. We wanted to create tasks that allow each individual to reminisce in the way they want whether it is in a digital or physical form. The six tasks we identified were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Going back through old media, such as photo albums, to reminisce.</strong></em>
In our survey, we saw that people enjoyed looking back on various forms of media to help them reminisce. For example, our first interview participant said she would like to record her memories with photos so she could look back on them for a better picture of the memory.</li>
<li><em><strong>Evaluating memories and actively highlighting “more valuable” ones.</strong></em>
This task arose from the fact that many participants recognized a difference between proactive and passive reflection. In the survey, several responses indicated that reminiscing on certains memories can be detrimental or painful. Because of this, we wanted the users of our design to be able to choose what memories are valuable to them to look back on.</li>
<li><em><strong>Recording in a journal as a way to process thoughts and emotions.</strong></em>
In our survey, many cited their reason for journaling as “a way to organize thoughts/feelings and make difficult decisions easier” and “to process some of the emotions I was having”. Writing can be a form of therapy and help people work out things which are complicated to keep track of mentally.</li>
<li><em><strong>Drawing insights and making goals pertaining to social experiences from recordings.</strong></em>
Journaling and reminiscing is often done out of a desire to understand one’s self better and, in most cases, to improve. It also, when done consistently, allows for a tracking of behaviors in day-to-day life and an observance of trends. Combining this desire for improvement with the tracking that journaling provides results in goal-setting, which we felt was a task was one our design should support.</li>
<li><em><strong>Regular intervals of recording everyday life in a journal</strong></em>
Memories are made up of facts. Without recording the context and detail of a memory—such as the who, the where, and the when— reflecting and subsequently setting goals is practically impossible. Thus, we felt that this task was of utmost importance to address in our design, as it supported all the others.</li>
<li><em><strong>Sharing past memories and accompanying thoughts with friends</strong></em>
Some of the best memories are the ones made with those we love. The desire to revisit memories and then share them was an experience that was mentioned in both our interviews and our surveys and thus one that we felt was important to consider with our design.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches:</h3>
<h4 id="physical-digital-interface">Physical + Digital Interface</h4>
<p>This design would involve a combination of smart physical devices as well as an online platform to collect memories from both the digital and physical realm, bridging the gap so that people are able to enjoy the benefits of digital convenience, while retaining the charm of physical experiences. By combining the two forms of medium you retain the authenticity and therapeutic nature of writing in a journal, but the digital complement allows for speed, which addresses many peoples’ concern of journaling taking too much time, as well as sharing and searching options, amongst other features that a physical book simply cannot provide on its own.</p>

<h4 id="online-app-that-centralizes-media-and-digital-presence">Online App that Centralizes Media and Digital Presence</h4>
<p>This design would be an online platform that grabs data from different services a user is a part of to provide a comprehensive overview of memories in different formats. For example, it might use the Facebook API and Spotify API to generate a scrapbook of your recent trip to Europe, combining the posts and photos you shared along with the music you listened to during your vacation. The goal of this design is to curate a digital snapshot using data that already exists, thus providing a lot of information in a much shorter amount of time.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/idea2_api.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our idea for an app that centralizes media and digital presence by connecting to different media platforms such as Spotify, Instagram, Facebook, or Google Photos to combine different mediums of memories together."></p>
<h4 id="customizable-physical-journal">Customizable Physical Journal</h4>
<p>This design is aimed to help people who want to start journaling or those that have some dissatisfaction with their physical journaling experience. It allows people to collect memories in a physical form but opens further flexibility as the journaling can change formats as they write and have the freedom to modify their journals as they see fit. This design is meant to accommodate and celebrate the really individual and personal nature of journaling, and provides people an opportunity to experiment with and curate a journal that works best for them.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/idea3_customizablejournal.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;" alt="A drawing of our Customizable Physical Journal idea that depicts a physical ring journal which can have pages inserted into it. Users can go online to select or design their own page layouts/prompts, and print them out to be inserted into their own journals."></p>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards:</h3>
<p>We decided to go with a combination of our Physical + Digital Interface idea as well as our API idea because the two together seemed to best address the three core goals of our project: recording, reminiscing, and reflecting. The Physical + Digital Interface idea directly connected to two of our research insights, that there are advantages to both physical and digital, as well as addressing the pain point of recording being time consuming. On the other hand, we felt that the API idea had better connection to another key idea, that people use different forms to reminisce, from music to photos. We decided that both could be incorporated into a single design, without adding too much complexity or detracting from each other. We also decided that the physical components of the Physical + Digital Interface idea, such as the smart pen or scanner, would add a cost barrier which would limit the number of potential users, and its functionality could easily be replaced by a smartphone camera which is more convenient. Ultimately, this combination of the two ideas becomes something which more resembles what we like to refer to as a “digital scrapbook”. We think that this can particularly help address the tasks of daily recording and evaluating memories to find those that are more valuable.</p>
<h4 id="storyboard-1">Storyboard 1</h4>
<p>This storyboard demonstrates how our design supports the task of recording everyday life. Based on the results of our research we realized that writing in a physical journal is an important way to do such recording, but not the only way. A written account provides only part of the full picture, which is why the digital component of our design also incorporates things such as music and photos. As shown, Greg returns from a long day and writes about the concert he attended but struggles to come up with much more to write. However, he realizes that there was more to his day than he is able to effectively articulate on paper, so he uses the digital component to curate a more complete picture. Remi-nice helped him more easily record his memories in a meaningful way.</p>

<h4 id="storyboard-2">Storyboard 2</h4>
<p>The task of evaluating memories with intent to highlight more valuable ones and filter unhelpful ones is of vital importance, as shown by our research. While reminiscing is an activity most take part in, there is a fine line between it being an effective means to revisit the past and a gateway to unnecessary dwelling. In this storyboard we demonstrate how Sally had a mostly good day, having done well on her exam and gotten lunch with her friend, but got into a small argument with her mother. However, although she writes about all of those events in her physical journal, she realizes that when she revisits her digital scrapbook she would rather focus on the positives, and thus only uploads what she chooses to.</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview:</h3>
<p>Studying is a universal struggle shared amongst students everywhere.  When completing their coursework, students have to juggle meeting deadlines, preventing burnout, avoiding distractions, measuring their own knowledge of their coursework, and aiming for solid grades.  Unfortunately, the fact that there is no universal best way to study makes this challenge even more difficult to solve.  Also, technology is now often used in curriculums across all disciplines.  Since technology (and more specifically, the internet) also can be a great distraction to students, for many students it can be incredibly difficult to manage staying on track when studying with tech-based resources.</p>
<p>Stud-e is a personalized study advisor app, using data recorded from past study sessions to help optimize students’ study session time usage.  Stud-e does so via tracking study sessions, recording students’ progress via either passive digital tool integration (i.e. Canvas) or actively surveying the student about their own progress after the completion of a study session.  It then references this data to provide feedback.  During future study sessions, stud-e actively provides guidance on how to best optimize students’ study time through an app-connected bracelet that guides users based upon productivity estimates derived from the collected data to take breaks, resume studying, or conclude their studies for the day.  The data is also compiled, analyzed, and stored in an easy-to-read format so that each student can observe how productive he/she was in prior sessions and consciously learn how to improve upon his/her past study habits.  Lastly, stud-e can block access to recorded distractions from breaks or unproductive sessions to prevent students from getting too off track in their studies.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants:</h3>
<p>In doing our research, our goal was to gain insight into the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which study habits are associated students with a good GPA/successful students.</li>
<li>Different types of study habits.</li>
<li>How people track their productivity.</li>
<li>Good/bad study environments.</li>
<li>Desired features in a study habits-improvement tool.</li>
<li>Break-taking habits.</li>
<li>How students deal with distractions.</li>
<li>How students allocate time for studies.</li>
<li>How much of the average student’s coursework is physical and how much is digital.</li>
</ul>
<p>By learning about the above, we would better be able to design a product around the needs of students that works within the limitations provided by their busy lives.</p>
<p>To complete our research, we completed structured interviews with six different participants spread across various ages, majors, levels of education, and gender.  We chose to do interviews as our study method since we (correctly) assumed that each student has their own unique study habits and that an interview format would be the most effective and efficient way to learn about them.  We made the interviews structured to somewhat standardize our results.  While we originally considered doing contextual inquiries as well, we could not figure out a way to do so without either messing up the results by making the participant aware of our presence or being creepy by telling a participant that we had been observing them without them knowing for an extended period of time.  To find interviewees, we both interviewed participants in Odegaard Library and interviewed friends we knew personally.  We did this since random interviewees may be more honest in their results, and familiar interviewees may care more about their answers and therefore be willing to go more in-depth about them.  Below is a quick overview of the demographics of each of the participants we interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew - 2nd Year CS Student interviewed at Odegaard Library.</li>
<li>John - 1st Year CS Student interviewed at Odegaard Library</li>
<li>Christopher - 2nd Year Undeclared Student intending to major in Physics interviewed at residence</li>
<li>Robert - 3rd Year Supply Chain/Business Student interviewed at residence</li>
<li>James - UW Class of 2019 Alumni in Biochemistry studying for MCATs interviewed in Tacoma</li>
<li>Pallavi - 2nd Year Business Student interviewed at residence</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes:</h3>
<p>In the end, our research was incredibly successful.  Across our participants, we received a diverse range of responses to each of our questions, providing us with a dataset from which we derived the following three themes:</p>
<h4 id="there-is-no-universal-best-way-to-study"><em>There is no universal “best way to study.”</em></h4>
<p>Across participants, the “best way to study” varied wildly;  in fact, some participants’ “best” ways to study were near-identical to others’ “worst” ways to study.  For example:  Christopher thrives on studying with friends from other classes, while Robert and James explicitly stated that they do poorly in those environments.  Some participants never take breaks (James, John), while others take breaks somewhat often (Robert, Andrew).  The discrepancies found between our participants’ study habits in our research indicate that whatever solution we come up with must tailor to the individual in some way.  This meant designing something that learns and informs what does/does not work for an individual from recording their study habits.</p>
<h4 id="studying-in-groups-is-often-desirable-but-can-go-poorly-for-a-litany-of-reasons"><em>Studying in groups is often desirable, but can go poorly for a litany of reasons.</em></h4>
<p>Not a single participant interviewed explicitly said that they did not want to study with others for a personal reason.  Some, in fact, reflected upon having extremely positive prior study experiences with other students.  However, all participants mentioned that group study sessions can be hard since a whole group can be distracted more easily than an individual.  James even mentioned that the amount of time often spent having to bridge the gaps in knowledge between participants deters him from studying in groups.  In our solution, we would need to tackle these issues of group distraction and comprehension.</p>
<h4 id="the-internet-is-both-a-requirement-to-complete-work-and-a-major-source-of-distractions"><em>The internet is both a requirement to complete work and a major source of distractions.</em></h4>
<p>All participants noted that their coursework most often requires a digital aspect, usually involving the internet.  Most participants mentioned websites and internet-based apps as a source of breaks and distractions as well.  The requirement of using the internet makes it a distracting temptation impossible to turn off.  Our solution would have to be able to help participants manage and focus their internet usage in a way that minimizes distractions and maximizes productivity during their study sessions.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks:</h3>
<p>After reflecting upon our design research interview transcripts and themes, we came up with the following potential tasks for our project:</p>
<h4 id="id-1-details-regarding-the-user-s-study-habits-are-recorded-and-used-to-generate-feedback-on-how-to-maximize-their-study-time"><em>1. Details regarding the user’s study habits are recorded and used to generate feedback on how to maximize their study time</em></h4>
<p>When interviewing students, it became apparent that time management and scheduling were common tasks across the interviewed students.  For example, Pallavi noted that she has to juggle events for her business fraternity, studying, doing chores, hanging out with friends, and more.  Since she has to schedule day-to-day events, she’d like to know what time of the day would be best for her to study most productively.  She noted that her focus varies depending on what point she is at in her day:  during some hours of the day, she is more distracted than others.  As a result, she ends up spending a lot of time trying to fit in studying whenever she has free time.  Obviously, this is less than optimal, so we decided our project could pursue this task.</p>
<h4 id="id-2-journaling-data-about-a-particular-study-session"><em>2. Journaling data about a particular study session</em></h4>
<p>Although gathering data may be useful in accomplishing our project’s goals, the collected data also can provide value to the user. For instance, when our design reports to the user for what percentage of study time they tend to spend productively, the user will be able to use that in the future to better estimate how much time he/she should allocate to accomplish a given study-related task. Metadata we believe our users would find useful for a given study session include: total time spent, time spent productively, time spent distracted, which apps or websites were accessed the most when distracted, when the session started, where the session took place, who else was present, and how productive the session subjectively felt to the user.</p>
<h4 id="id-3-coordinating-and-making-group-study-time-as-productive-as-possible"><em>3. Coordinating and making group study time as productive as possible</em></h4>
<p>As mentioned in the theme-section above, no participant explicitly said that he/she was opposed to studying with others.  However, John, Christopher, and James all described instances where studying in a group actively detracted from their productivity.  For John and Christopher, one member in each of their study groups managed to derail the whole groups’ studying efforts.  For James, one group member’s competency in the curriculum was below the rest, so everyone was stuck teaching him in order to get him caught up on the materials.  In all cases, one group member burned through valuable study time.  We decided to look into having our project tackle this task in order to help allow for more-productive group work.</p>
<h4 id="id-4-managing-and-tracking-appropriate-breaks"><em>4. Managing and tracking appropriate breaks</em></h4>
<p>Taking breaks is key to a successful study session, so it was pretty unfortunate when we found that students often mismanaged their breaks.  James, for example, studies for extremely long, continual periods without breaks due to the little study time he has, leading to burnout.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, Christopher would take breaks that often overstayed their welcome, leading to nothing getting done at all.  Thus, he typically decides to take very few.  Since taking a study break to refresh yourself is key to student success, we decided to pursue creating a solution that manages suggesting and providing optimal breaks for students.</p>
<h4 id="id-5-alerting-users-when-they-ve-been-not-productive-distracted-for-too-long"><em>5. Alerting users when they’ve been not productive/distracted for too long</em></h4>
<p>As mentioned in the previous task, some students (such as Christopher), take a break and get distracted for far too long.  This (obviously) results in getting very little done over a very long period of time.  This very obviously detracts from student productivity, so we decided that our project should probably pursue this task by keeping track of the nature and length of the breaks students are taking.</p>
<h4 id="id-6-managing-to-do-lists-and-tracking-progress"><em>6. Managing to-do lists and tracking progress</em></h4>
<p>When interviewed, Pallavi noted that she often struggles to stay on topic during study sessions, mostly due to the fact that she feels overwhelmed with different, multi-component-based tasks. She wishes there was a way for her to systematically track and visualize her progress on all the different tasks she was working on. She believes that having a better way to track her productivity and using it will keep her more engaged with the content she is working on. Additionally, John noted that he uses many of the current applications that are out there to manage to-do lists and track his progress, but he doesn’t feel “motivated” to continue using them after a short period of time. With a simple yet effective way to manage to-do lists and track progress, he believes that he will be more inclined to stick with these tools, thereby improving his productivity.  Based off of these two interviews, we decided that the task of managing and tracking progress in coursework would be integral to our final product.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<p>With the research process complete and some key functionalities laid out before us, it was time to begin brainstorming. Ultimately we produced three distinct designs, each with a different idea at its core. First, there was the self-journaling design, which emphasized user-provided, qualitative data. Second was the group study design, which was all about helping people collaborate productively. Then last we had our automated design which centered around making the process of studying as simple as possible for the user.</p>
<h4 id="design-1-journaling"><em>Design 1: Journaling</em></h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design1.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This first design is a mobile application that stores information collected from the user about their previous study sessions. As soon as a user finishes studying for the day, they would fill out a short questionnaire concerning the session and how certain factors affected their productivity. This questionnaire would be centered around collecting data that is subjective to the user, thus capturing information that no automatic process running in the background could.</p>
<p>Questions of this type include:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a scale from 1-to-5 how productive did this session feel to you?</li>
<li>On a scale from 1-to-5 how much stress were you feeling when you started studying and how much are you feeling now?</li>
<li>Are you happy with how this session turned out?  Why or why not?</li>
<li>Do you feel some part of the environment played a positive or negative role in your ability to focus?</li>
<li>Were other people around you?  If so, how do you feel they affected your productivity?</li>
</ul>
<p>The responses to these questions would then be logged for future reference for the user, in hopes of creating a sense of mindfulness. Our research tells us that the simple act of considering questions like those above can allow the user to gain insight about themselves that they wouldn’t otherwise.  Users may realize things such as:  “Wow, whenever I study in the library I end up putting a one or two down for my productivity, maybe I should stick to studying in my room!”</p>
<p>Other features this designs supports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple to-do list program</li>
<li>Logging the length and frequency of breaks</li>
<li>A place to record miscellaneous notes about every session</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="design-2-collaboration"><em>Design 2: Collaboration</em></h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/design2.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>This design was envisioned as a desktop program with a mobile companion, and as stated above, it was all about helping groups coordinate study plans and work in tandem. This began by supporting a feature often neglected in other collaboration tools, helping groups of users find common openings in their schedules. Upon creating a new group activity in the app, users would have entered in their contact information as well as what days and times they'd be available. Once all group members had done so, our design would then identify times in which every schedule was simultaneously open and then recommend study sessions in such times.</p>
<p>Once in a study session, our design offers embedded Skype integration for those who need to work together remotely and/or need screen-sharing functionality. The app would also monitor which websites users visit and check them against a list of those deemed unproductive. If a user is unproductive for too long their name will turn red on everyone else’s screen and the gentle nudge of peer pressure would hopefully get them back on track.</p>
<p>Other features this designs supports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinating overlapping breaks among group members.</li>
<li>Logging and reporting how much time each user spent productively in a given session.</li>
<li>Identifying individuals who are especially distracting to the group and politely asking them to get back on task.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="design-3-automation"><em>Design 3: Automation</em></h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/chosen-design.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>For our third design, we have a mobile app connecting to a computer for  dual functionality. Studying can be a tedious and mentally-draining process, so the goal of this design is to reduce the user's mental load as much as possible. One of the features in this design that best exemplifies this philosophy is our automatic to-do list and planner system. Stud-e can be linked to Canvas to find information regarding a user’s academic schedule such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does the user’s class schedule look like?</li>
<li>When and where are upcoming tests and other academic events?</li>
<li>What assignments does the user have, and when are they due?</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is then synthesized into both a to-do list and a planner. This is because our design research showed that people felt that the pencil and paper equivalent of such features were convenient, but too much of a hassle to maintain.</p>
<p>The second way we make studying easier through automation is by blocking distracting material while the user is studying. Upon first opening the application, the user is asked to supply a list of websites that they find distracting. Then, whenever the user wants to study, they’ll press a button and every website on the list will be automatically blocked from their phone and computer until they terminate the study session, eliminating some distractions.</p>
<p>Another important feature of this design is a companion device in the form of a featureless white cube. When the user is productive this cube will glow green, if they spend too much time on unproductive websites not yet on the ban list, the cube will turn red and make a noise to remind them to get back on track.</p>
<p>Other features that this design supports include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing suggestions to the user regarding optimal study conditions based on their personal data</li>
<li>Recommending a healthy schedule of breaks so the user doesn’t overwork or burn out</li>
<li>Recommending new websites for the ban list if they appear to be distracting the user</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h3>
<p>Ultimately the design we chose to move forward with was Design 3. This design was chosen primarily through process of elimination. Design 1, we decided, was not the right choice because it demanded a lot of the user’s time and attention and our research tells us that that does not appeal to users at all. Design 2’s collaboration aspect, while appealing on the surface, consumed too much of the project’s identity, leaving it lacking in many of the features that we felt were important.</p>
<p>Although Design 3 was our final choice, it did not come out of this process unaltered. Most notably, we changed the companion cube into a bracelet in order to increase its portability. Additionally, instead of making a noise when the user is distracted, it vibrates instead so as to not disturb others in public workspaces such as libraries.</p>

<ng-template #designresearch_tidy>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Tidy's primary objective  is to optimize and simplify household management among shared living spaces such as dorms, apartments, and houses. In many of these living situations, the lack of an authority figure and/or individual accountability often leads to disorganized shared spaces, miscommunication, and tension among roommates or housemates. A household management platform such as Tidy would not only increase the livability of a household, but also alleviate potential disputes and help to maintain relationships. Aspects of shared living that Tidy addresses include chore delegation, finance management, scheduling, and communication.</p>
<p>Our solution to these household issues takes the form of a smartphone application, which leverages the feasibility and universal adoption of smartphones. Because household members are not home for a significant portion of the day, we needed our design to be both portable and convenient to access at all times. This property allows us to maximize the utility of features such as messaging and expense management. While other proposed designs such as a smartboard or smartwatch have their advantages, we believe that an all-in-one smartphone application for household management will ultimately allow for the greatest balance of both convenience and performance.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-approach">Design Research Approach</h3>
<p>Although all Tidy members have experienced shared living in our college career, our knowledge regarding this broad topic was still extremely limited. As a result, the primary goal for our design research was to gather a comprehensive collection of data and observations across a wide variety of living situations, including dorms, shared apartments, and even families. We further diversified our research by considering a range of roommate and housemate relationships, from best friends to former strangers.  Our research focused on these aspects of shared living: type of living situation, household chores, roommate relationships, conflict resolution, technology aids, and roommate relationships.</p>
<p>We chose to conduct semi-structured interviews as our primary design research method. The main advantage of interviews was the level of depth and detail it allowed for, especially in regards to specific household practices and circumstances. Although we initially considered contextual inquiries or focus groups, we decided that most of the relevant insight they would offer in regards to our problem space could also be obtained in an interview setting. To ensure that participants would be comfortable sharing about sensitive topics such as household conflict and roommate tension, we planned most of our interviews in a one-on-one setting. This gave participants the ability to confidentially discuss issues regarding other roommates, with the guarantee that their responses would not be shared or used outside of our design research process. To minimize the effect of personal bias on our research analysis, we scheduled separate interviews for multiple members of the same household to ensure well-rounded responses.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results">Design Research Results</h3>
<p>Our design research revealed a number of common patterns, most of which stemmed from a lack of household organization. Key insights and themes included chores being divided agreeably but not equally, disagreements on household standards, and a lack of proper organizational tools. These insights helped to inform our design direction and were derived directly from the various perspectives we gathered during the interview process.</p>
<p><strong>Chores are divided agreeably, but not equally.</strong> In most of our interviews, we found that chore workload was not being fairly divided among housemates, but rather in a way that was most easily agreed upon. One interviewee noted that &quot;It is hard to force someone to do something. Sometimes you just end up doing their chores for them or saying 'lets do it together'&quot;. Often times, one or two individuals end up taking on more of the burden. Chore assignments are typically determined verbally and managed mentally, which can make it difficult to come to a fair agreement that can also be easily maintained between all of the roommates.</p>
<p><strong>Agreeing upon standards and guidelines for clean living.</strong> When roommates do not share a fundamental understanding of what it means for the house to be clean deciding who does what becomes very messy. Imagine a situation where Sandra believes cleaning the bathroom to involve wiping down the counters and sink, scrubbing the toilet and shower, and mopping the floors, but Jimmy thinks that it is just replacing the toilet paper and making sure the toilet is not clogged. These differences in opinion introduce a lot of complexity in deciding who does what. Maybe you have to avoid having Jimmy cleaning the bathroom because you know he will not do it well, or Sandra ends up having to do extra work when she is assigned dishes but then the bathroom is a mess when she goes to use it. During an interview an interviewee had noted &quot;People have different standards or definitions of what constitutes clean, so if the app could outline standards or guidelines that would be helpful.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Combinations of tools not meant for managing a household are lacking.</strong> Very commonly our interviewees were using a combination of facebook messenger and venmo as their primary means of managing their household. Both of these tools have the foundational abilities to facilitate communication and financial transactions between roommates respectively but lack organization for managing a household. One continuous communication stream makes it hard to remember how it was agreed who would do what, needing to scroll all the way back to when it was decided to remember who does what. Similarly manually dividing up costs and sending individual requests is cumbersome, letting shared expenses slip through the cracks because they are too small to care about. Adding extra structure as wrappers to these tools that supply the foundational abilities is something that all of our interviews saw as something useful.</p>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Establishing Household Standards/Guidelines</em></p>
<p><strong>People have differing opinions in regards to what &quot;clean&quot; entails - thus, it is important to have clear household standards and guidelines.</strong> Many of our participants did not have clearly defined roles in the household which led to sporadic completion of chores by random housemates. While this method may thrive in living situations where housemates are close friends, we found that it was often a primary source of housemate disagreement and conflict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Maintaining Accountability</em></p>
<p><strong>Lack of an authoritative figure leads to accountability issues.</strong> Multiple participants mentioned that house members who do not pull their weight ultimately force others to carry their burden and complete their responsibilities. This could lead to passive aggressive confrontations between roommates and can strain relationships within the living space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Assigning Chores Based on Preference</em></p>
<p><strong>Certain members of a household may prefer one chore over another.</strong> In our research, we discovered that there were typically imbalances in household chore workloads. While this problem can be partially explained by a lack of accountability, we were interested in finding additional explanations to account for this imbalance. If members of a household are better suited to doing a specific chore over another, they could be better motivated to complete their assigned responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tracking Shared Expenses</em></p>
<p><strong>Tracking shared household expenses in a clear and transparent manner.</strong> We discovered through our interviews that money was a primary focus across our participant pool. All households had some form of shared expenses, such as groceries, cleaning supplies, or rent/utilities. Applications such as Venmo and Google Sheets were commonly utilized by our participants to manage shared finances, which motivated us to incorporate a feature that allowed for both tracking and paying for shared expenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Schedule Considerations</em></p>
<p><strong>Considering individual schedules in regards to chore distribution and overall household management.</strong> Because a majority of our participants were young working adults and students, their schedules were typically busy. Considering the daily schedules of users in order to fairly distribute the household workload was thus an important consideration. Participants also appreciated when their roommates let them know beforehand when guests would be over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Maintaining Positive Housemate Relationships</em></p>
<p><strong>Minimizing housemate conflict and strained relationships stemming from poor household management.</strong> Some of our participants had issues with their roommates that resulted from a lack of accountability and poor management of the living space. There were often passive aggressive interactions between roommates and some had difficulty with confrontation which progressed these interactions further.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-sketches">Design Sketches</h3>
<p>The following illustrations depict three design directions that were considered during our ideation phase. The first design represents a mobile app concept, followed by a reimagined home &quot;smartboard&quot;, and a robotic companion that monitors chore completion status.</p>
<h4 id="mobile-app">Mobile App</h4>
<p>Our smartphone application design serves as a hub for a variety of household-related functions. This app allows users to check the completion status of certain chores, as well as the housemate responsible for completing the chore. Communication is another primary focus of this design - as a result, the app includes a messaging feature that allows roommates to send quick reminders or updates to one another. Finally, the app serves as an analytics and monitoring tool for shared household expenses. Shared transactions would be transparent to all household members, and notifications would alert members of their current dues or charges.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/app.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Figure 1. Mobile App design - sketch for household management tool.</p>
<h4 id="smartboard">Smartboard</h4>
<p>This design reimagines the common whiteboarding experience that many households still use to manage their homes. The smartboard aims to preserve the traditional writing experience while also allowing users to swap between multiple interfaces. One of the primary features of this design is that users would be able to leave anonymous comments on the board, serving as a non-aggressive way to remind roommates to do something. Moreover, because this would be a digital experience, users wouldn't have to worry about their comments being accidentally erased as the smartboard can autosave important information. Similar to the mobile app, the smartboard also comes equipped with additional features and interfaces such as scheduling, finances, and chore delegation.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smartboard.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Figure 2. Smartboard sketch showcasing multiple interfaces and ability to write comments.</p>
<h4 id="mr-clean">Mr. Clean</h4>
<p>Our final design concept was rather outlandish and bold, but it addresses an aspect of shared living that often generates conflict. Introducing Mr. Clean, your new robotic roommate. Mr. Clean serves as a 3rd-party household mediator, primarily functioning to preserve the peace by alleviating the pressure of roommate confrontation. Mr. Clean routinely patrols the house and scans high priority rooms such as the bathroom, kitchen, and living room. If Mr. Clean detects a messy environment, he will actively seek the roommate responsible for maintaining that specific room and remind them to do their chores. Mr. Clean will also remind members of household cleaning standards if they consistently underperform. This design seeks to eliminate passive aggressive confrontation between roommates by leveraging an unbiased, fact-based system.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/robot.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Figure 3. Mr. Clean the 3rd party household mediator.</p>
<h3 id="selected-design">Selected Design</h3>
<p>Moving forward we chose to expand on the app design for managing households. The app would mainly hold two functions of allowing each member of the household to view the chores that they have to complete and view the share of the expenses that they owe towards managing the household. In addition, the app would have other subfunctions to help in maintaining the chore structure and financials. We chose to pursue this design over the smart board and the robot helper/mediator. One reason was because we knew from the interviews that most were expecting an app to be developed to help them manage the house. In addition, we knew most users would not want to invest too much money into managing their household and the robot or smart board would be seen as a much greater investment than an app.</p>
<h3 id="storyboards">Storyboards</h3>
<h4 id="chore-accountability">Chore Accountability</h4>
<p>In this storyboard, we can see the user using the app to maintain accountability with completing chores. First, we see that the dishes have not been completed yet. Then, we see the person who was assigned the chore get a notification reminding them to complete the chore. Having seen the alert the user goes and completes the chore. Then after the chore is completed, they take a picture to verify that it was completed.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/storyboard1.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="shared-expense-tracking">Shared Expense Tracking</h4>
<p>In this storyboard we outline how the app would be used to help maintain financial accountability in the household. First, one of the users in the household notices that some shared items in the kitchen have been used up. So, the user heads to the store and purchases the shared items. After purchasing the items, the user inputs what he bought and the other roommates are notified of the new expense.</p>

<!--
TODO: It would be nice to have a place to put their tagline
AN EASY WAY TO TRACK AND SCAPE THE VAPE
--> 
<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>Electronic cigarettes and vaporizers have become popularized among teenagers, youths, and people who replaced traditional smoking with e-cigarettes. In fact, they were marketed as an easy way to quit traditional cigarettes, however, they are not an effective tool to quit nicotine completely, and they became a new way of addiction to nicotine with higher demand. Also, vaping has caused an inessential significant expense for the user as well.</p>
<p>We offer a beneficial solution called VapeWeight consisting of a smartphone application and a physical component. The physical component has the capability of both charging the vape device through a USB outlet and weighing the vape’s cartridge by a very sensitive scale sensor designated to keep track of the user’s daily nicotine intake. Every user can see their progress through the data collected on the VapeWeight application as well as joining the community forum on the app helping each other become vape free.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-goals-methods-and-participants">Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</h3>
<p>The main focus of this project was to provide those who regularly vape a way to track the amount of nicotine vaped over time. Due to the increasing popularity of vaping in young adults, we focused our research participants among college students and young adults - both those who have used e-cigarettes exclusively as well as those who have switched from cigarettes to vaping as a means of quitting tobacco products. Other stakeholders we consider are high school-aged students. Although buying cigarettes and e-cigarettes are now limited to those 21 and over, research still shows vaping to be on the rise among this age group. Therefore, we conducted three different methods of interviews, diary studies, and surveys in order to better understand their needs and desire to quit vaping.</p>
<p>We decided on semi-structured interviews to allow us to observe their behaviors while asking them detailed questions. On the other hand, diary studies of our participants gave us insight into their psychological, physical, and social factors at their peak times. A survey was also an effective way to collect useful data on a larger scale, such as what participants’ current mental state is on quitting, how they feel about tracking their vaping usage, and what kinds of designs they prefer to use for quitting.</p>
<p>We conducted interviews and diary studies from a college student at the University of Washington who is also in the Greek community as vape usage in that community are high, an individual in the Seattle area between 25 - 40 years of age who replaced traditional cigarettes with e-cigarettes, and two different smoke shop owners. All other participants filled out the survey, and they were primarily college and high school students.</p>
<h3 id="design-research-results-and-themes">Design Research Results and Themes</h3>
<p>According to the results of interviews, surveys, and diary studies that we conducted from all participants, we acquired a variety of information and key themes as follow:</p>
<h4 id="social-motivation">Social Motivation</h4>
<p>Those in a younger crowd are easily influenced by what their friends are doing, and all of our participants have indicated that they began and continue to vape due to social pressures, usually, their close friends are all regular vapers as well. When asked what might motivate participants to quit, some indicated that having others quit with them could help.</p>
<h4 id="use-of-e-cigarettes-as-a-tool-to-quit-tobacco">Use of E-cigarettes as a Tool to Quit Tobacco</h4>
<p>Our participants over 25 years old were all previous smokers and initially began vaping because they 1) wanted to quit tobacco completely, or 2) wanted to switch without the intent of quitting because they thought it was a “healthier” alternative.</p>
<h4 id="no-current-effective-tool">No Current Effective Tool</h4>
<p>From our research, there is nothing currently on the market explicitly for the purposes of quitting/monitoring the use of e-cigarettes without manual tracking. Traditional methods, such as patches and gum, are effective for the physical aspect but do not account for the psychological and social aspects which have become so synonymous with vaping. There is a mobile app that describes itself as being “the only app specifically for quitting vaping/juuling”. However, the user is required to track with another friend who vapes, and both individuals must monitor each others progress. The app also does not account for the difficulties of manual tracking. Furthermore, this app is useless if individuals want to quit without friends.</p>
<h4 id="college-aged-students-plan-to-quit-before-graduating">College-Aged Students Plan to Quit Before Graduating</h4>
<p>Our participants who began vaping when they were 18-21 years-old have all indicated that they hope to quit by the time they are 22. This is generally the age when students graduate from college. It is a fair assumption that these individuals might only consider vaping to be a “college habit” and do not believe this addiction could carry on beyond that.</p>
<h3 id="identified-tasks">Identified Tasks</h3>
<p>Based on our key findings and the main themes that we concluded from our studies, we decided to choose the following six tasks as the most important factors to consider in designing our solution.</p>
<p><b>Curbing cravings</b> of nicotine is very hard for a person who tries to either quit or eliminate his intake. This person might have strong cravings but do not want to talk about it due to the stigma around addiction. Having access to tips from people who were in their same positions and a community to talk about craving symptoms might help him to have the motivation to continue in his journey to quitting.</p>
<p><b>Learning about research on health risks of vaping</b> can also be helpful to motivate vape users to think more about their physical and mental health as well as helping those who are trying to quit to keep up with their good works throughout this challenging journey.</p>
<p><b>Connecting with friends and family to keep yourself accountable</b> is another way of motivating people to keep doing their hard work because sharing their vape usage keeps them accountable to themselves as well as others. They suspect that the one person who decreases her usage the most would get “bragging rights”. This would deliver a psychological reward and help to continue decreasing use.</p>
<p><b>Reducing vape usage / Gaining insights from tracked data</b> is a better approach for people who do not want to quit at once. If they keep track of their use, they would know how much they have vaped during a certain time, and they would be able to decrease it gradually.</p>
<p><b>Automatic tracking of how much nicotine/e-cigarette pods were vaped each day</b> is very needed for a person who wants to quit since manual tracking of e-cig liquid or the number of puffs taken during the day is almost impossible. Thus, the automatic taking of nicotine intake is an important and necessary task to consider.</p>
<p><b>Keeping track of money spent on buying E-liquids</b> is an important task to think about since vaping has caused a significant financial expense for the user in daily life. It can also become a motivation to quit for those who care about their spendings.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-design-sketches">Proposed Design Sketches</h3>
<h4 id="design-1-mobile-app-scaling-sensor">Design 1: Mobile App &amp; Scaling Sensor</h4>
<p>This design incorporates a physical component as well as a mobile application. The physical component is meant to be a simple, user-friendly, frustration-free device for gathering data. The main feature of the component is a drop-in area located on the top of the component weighs the vape cartridge. There is an indicator light to communicate to the user if the scale is functioning correctly or not. An additional feature on the component is a USB outlet for convenient charging of the vape battery. We chose to incorporate a battery charger to help the user remember to weigh their cartridge while they charge their battery. The other component of this design is the mobile application that gains insights from the data gathered from the physical component via Bluetooth. The app contains trends and data of user’s vape usage, user’s profile, and a community forum the features we considered to be most important to the user: tracking vape usage, tracking spending, finding an online community of other users trying to quit, and learning about important health topics related to vape research.</p>

<h4 id="design-2-smart-portable-device">Design 2: Smart Portable Device</h4>
<p>The second design is a sensor that operates with batteries and is attached to the vape button, so it will account for each time the user hits their device. When the user first gets the product they will have options on an app in their phone with equivalencies for cigarettes. Corresponding to each option, information about health risks is received. For instance, if the user vapes very little they will be given information about short term effects like anxiety, where someone who smokes about a pack per day will be given health risks about the long term including cancer. Based on the user’s choice, the device will alert how close they are to their daily limit with different lights. When they are not close to their daily limit the light will be green, then go to yellow, and red when they are at their limit. This can help the user pace themselves out as they go so they don’t have to wait to see where they are at.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smart_portable_sketch.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-3-smart-watch-app-e-cigarette">Design 3: Smart Watch App &amp; E-Cigarette</h4>
<p>The third design includes a rechargeable e-cig and a smartwatch. The e-cigarette has a similar shape to many popular vapes now but has a screen on the handle that designates the percentage of the pod vaped and/or how many puffs have been taken that day out of the desired puffs they have indicated. In fact, the e-cigarette itself has a sensor built inside that tracks the usage. The user has the option to buy pods that have different amounts of nicotine. The sensor in the e-cigarette will be able to distinguish the nicotine amount apart by barcodes on the pods. The smartwatch app is connected to the e-cigarette through Bluetooth and shows the data on the e-cigarette screen as well. Users are able to set a limit of how much they want to vape that day, either through pod percentage or amount of puffs. Once they have reached their desired limit, the e-cigarette will not allow them to vape until the next day.</p>

<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/smart_watch_sketch.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 650px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="selected-design-and-storyboards">Selected Design and Storyboards</h4>
<p>We decided to continue with our first design, the “Mobile App &amp; Scaling Sensor”. We believe it would be the most convenient option for the user since there is no need to buy a new device, and it works with any kinds of vape devices/cartridges. For our design, we are focusing on the tasks of automatic tracking and connecting with friends and family. We decided to focus on these tasks, firstly, because we found no products on the market with the automatic tracking feature. From our research, many participants cited the challenge of manually tracking their vape usage due to the subconscious and habitual nature of vaping. Secondly, we want to leverage the social aspect of vaping, a recurring topic in most of our interviews with college-aged users. Because accountability is one of the most important aspects of undertaking the challenge of quitting tobacco products.</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>Existing moderation techniques demand constant diligence or impose expectations of complete sobriety. We typically adopt these techniques in response to a crisis. However, there is a large population of individuals who have not encountered a crisis, but spend and drink more than they desire. This problem is exacerbated by college budgets, liquor taxes, and youthful exuberance. Our aim is to establish consciousness of high-risk consumption habits in these social drinkers. Cha$r supports personal benchmarking and goal-setting without intruding on cherished celebratory spaces or dominating one’s attention. Our solution focuses on simplifying “in-the-moment” personal accountability to its most straight-foward and aggregating data that communicates habits.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>Our first paper prototype features our initial interface and interactions. We designed our prototypes to focus on two key tasks for our social drinkers: setting their spending and drinking limits before the night out and counting their drinks and tracking their spending while out.</p>

<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<p>Our iteration cycle took advantage of feedback gathered during three distinct stages. Between each stage and each participant, the design was modified and evaluation methods were adjusted to fix the issues that surfaced.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Heuristic Evaluation:</strong> We explained the design to a participant. They pointed out a variety of issues that we categorized using heuristic types and severity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> We presented a participant with a setting and tasks that we wanted them to complete. We then observed their interaction with the design and noted any issues. Finally we asked the participant for any explicit feedback on either the design or the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Review:</strong> We explained the original and current design to a group of experts and gathered feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While the first and last stage were performed once, usability testing was performed on multiple participants. The setting and the tasks that they were asked to perform changed with each participant to better reflect motivations for using the design and the natural setting that it would be used in.</p>
<p>Initially we asked the user to set a limit on a specific date and then attempt to record consuming a drink. This resulted in a rigid and limited interaction with the design that we felt did not accurately represent how it would be used in the wild. After adjustments, the final prompt instead mentioned that the participant was going to attend an event on a specific date and that they were motivated to not overdrink or overspend. After observing their interaction, we then placed the participant at the event and told them that they have just consumed a drink and were motivated to check on their progress. We also removed hints toward application terminology in our prompt’s language, such as the phrase “set a limit”. The final prompt provided a more open-ended context that allowed the participant to explore the design more realistically and thoroughly.</p>
<h4 id="participants">Participants</h4>
<p><strong>Heuristic Evaluation:</strong> Conducted during lecture with a peer from HCI class.</p>
<p><strong>Usability Test 1:</strong> Conducted at the Allen Library Research Commons with a peer in the HCDE department.</p>
<p><strong>Usability Test 2:</strong> Conducted in a classroom during section with a peer from our HCI class.</p>
<p><strong>Usability Test 3:</strong> Conducted at the Allen Library Research Commons with a 21 year old Asian male.</p>
<p><strong>Design Review:</strong> Conducted in a classroom during section with peers from our HCI class and TAs.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results">Testing Results</h3>
<p>During the testing there were two major themes for the flaws that surfaced in our design. Many changes of various scale were applied as it went through numerous iterations. Shown below are some of the bigger and more impactful adjustments that were made to address these two themes.</p>
<h4 id="navigation">Navigation</h4>
<p>There was a fundamental inefficiency in how the screens were organized in the initial paper prototype. Participants often felt like they had to perform more actions than were needed or they got lost in the screens. While this issue existed in both of the applications, the impact was more substantial on the mobile side which required drastic changes. Outside of inefficiency we also had issues with certain elements of the design being misidentified as interactive or not.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/SET_LIMITS_BEFORE.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/SET_LIMITS_AFTER.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>
<p>During our usability test, we found that many of our participants would attempt to click on the limits that were enclosed in boxes and circles when we asked them to set their drinking or spending limit instead of clicking the edit button. Our participants mentioned that the numbers appeared to be clickable due to being enclosed in a box or circle, and that they didn’t notice the edit button until after spending some time looking through the screen. To fix this, we removed all the boxes and circles around the numbers to prevent the participants from trying to click on them to set their limits, and made the edit button larger to grab their attention from the start.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/HOME_SCREEN_BEFORE.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/HOME_SCREEN_AFTER.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>
<p>Another issue we found during our testing was our home page. When the participants were asked to set their drinking limit, some would attempt to tap the bottom left box on the home screen. The bottom left box was designed to show participants the current state of how much they spent and drank, but does not do anything when clicked. The main screen was serving a confusing dual function as both a landing page and portal between possible tasks. To fix this, we made the home page into a welcome screen. It greets the user and informs them of their current drinking and spending state through dialogue instead of a button-like box. In addition, graphics of the same information provide a visual alternative that eases comparison against your limit. A persistent on-screen toolbar now handles task navigation, since we expect users to jump between limit-setting and performance review. A similar fix was deployed for the watch, which displayed a two-option menu screen that placed inebriated users an extra touch away from recording their drinks. This extraneous menu was eliminated at this stage.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<h4 id="information-organization-and-representation">Information Organization and Representation</h4>
<p>Participants also had difficulty understanding the information shown during tracking on their smart watch and accessing the data tracked later on their mobile device. This is both due to that data sometimes being strictly not accessible or it being shown in a confusing manner. Changes were made both to the smart watch and the mobile application to address these issues.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>A wearer had no way of examining their data from previous weeks. This was at odds with our vision of users exploring a series of previous nights-out to inform themselves during the limit choosing task. For example, if a user can recall feeling sick the day of their sister’s wedding, they might want to go quite far back in their history to review the count of drinks consumed that day. To address this, we added calendar functionality to the graph, allowing one to change the displayed month and year. We feel this access to a long-term counting history is critical in the formation of future goals and the avoidance of past mistakes.</p>

</p>
<p>During the usability testing and design review we found that people had a hard time figuring out where to find the track history button and confusing it with the current statistics button. We decided to separate these components and make the current statistics the main visual in the home page and moved the tracking button to a navigation bar. The home page greets people and lists current statistics (amount of drinks consumed and money spent) and the limits on drinks and spending they set for themselves. This visual representation is more effective because it shows people immediate information that is pertinent (current statistics compared to their set limits) and fixes the navigation problem within the home screen.</p>

</p>
<p>During our design review we found that the buttons for counting drinks on the watch were not intuitive. Since they were all one color with small icons, it was hard to find the difference between the buttons and did not provide an affordance to click. To combat this, we kept the icons but made the buttons different colors. Separating the buttons using color, in addition to the drink icons, would make it easier for people to differentiate the buttons, especially if they are intoxicated and cannot read the icons.</p>

<h4 id="adjustments">Adjustments</h4>
<p>The main adjustment we made to the watch was adding a different color to each of the buttons to count drinks. By adding different colors, the buttons now afford clicking and helps people differentiate the buttons especially when they are intoxicated. In addition, the centralized theme of our watch and phone system is based on more pastel colors with the main color being a periwinkle blue to symbolize calmness. We used a dark theme in the smart watch app and a light theme in the phone app to separate the two modes, and is also symbolic for monitoring on the night out and reflecting the day after.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>We removed the line graph on the money history menu in favor of a bar graph. We made this change because the previous style of graph implied a continuous increase in spending between nights out, which isn’t an accurate model of the wearer’s discrete purchases. Using the same graph style as in the alcohol tab also maintains internal consistency. Finally, the switch above the graph prominently signals the activated mode which reduces the need to visually distinguish the two graphs, particularly in a manner that obfuscates the core data.</p>

<ng-template #designprototyping_doze>
<p>### Problem and Solution Overview
Sleep, especially for college-aged adolescents, is a crucial necessity. However,
many students have let it fall to the bottom of their priorities. Amid the pressure
of school, work, extracurricular activities, and social events, college students
fail to find the time to sleep. Our group in our design asked ourselves:</p>
<p><strong>How do we facilitate proper sleeping habits for those that can sleep earlier but won't?</strong></p>
<p>Our solution combines tracking, social networking, and sleep science into Doze: A Smart Pillow.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initialmobileprototype.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initialpillowinsertpaperprototype.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>In our initial paper prototype, we capture the basic functionality we wanted to incorporate
into our design. Our interface includes features such as a character or avatar to display
a user's progress, a small social network that allows users to share sleep habits, long-term
selfie tracking, a gallery of articles on sleep, and pillow controls.</p>
<p>The first task, creating a live progress tracker between users, is accomplished through the
social page of the app. A user can share their progress with others and the app facilitates
a competition based on the sleep data collected by their pillow. The app displays detailed
information on other people's sleep, so a user can understand what works well for others in
the community and adapt their own sleep habits based on that information.</p>
<p>The second task is to cultivate a relaxed mindset and environment for better sleep. Our pillow
tracks sleep data, such as hours slept, room temperature, and noise level. A user can use
this data to inform their decisions and get better sleep. If the user struggles to sleep,
they can check the app for recommendations from others or suggestions based on the data
collected by the pillow. The pillow additionally can play music to help the user fall
asleep or play an alarm in the morning to make a phone unnecessary for sleep.</p>
<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<p>In each of the usability tests we conducted, we discussed how the test would be run with the
participant and afterwards debriefed the experience with them. During each test, Ying
ran the test and gave the participant tasks, Zoe recorded video of the test, and Kevin and
Geovani observed the participant's interactions. During the test, the participant was asked
to find their friend's score, find a certain data point in their report, and take a selfie.
We additionally allowed each participant time to explore the app and during the debrief asked
which features they liked, which ones felt unnecessary, and why they would or wouldn't use the
product.</p>
<p>We conducted these tests with three participants.  Our first participant was a prior CSE 440
student and the test took place in CSE2. We approached this participant because we wanted advice
from someone with experience in UI/UX. This participant is majoring in computer science and
currently is pursuing a career in UI/UX, so they had plenty of experience in the area. After
their test, we were able to refine our questions and tasks to be more focused and clear. It was
also after this test that we figured out the questions asked during debrief for future tests.</p>
<p>Our second participant was a computer science student and teaching assistant. This participant
offered a unique perspective because while he had a lot of technical experience, making
much of his insight unique from the previous test's participant. His advice helped us to
identify areas with unclear purpose and issues with privacy, which we used to modify the
prototype before our final test.</p>
<p>Our last test was with an HCI major at UW, conducted at the participant's house. We knew this
participant would have deeper insights considering her extensive experience with design. She
told us that our design was already clear and usable, but her suggestions greatly improved
the layout of the app to be more convenient and pertinent to the user's current needs.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement">Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</h3>
<p>Our testing identified the following issues which needed to be addressed.</p>
<h4 id="login-information">Login information</h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/login.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Many participants told us that privacy was a major concern with this app. Our original prototype
only had options for logging in with Facebook, Instagram, or Google to help with the social
aspect of the app. After listening to user concerns, we decided to add a proprietary log in
system for users who did not want their sleep data shared with these companies.</p>
<h4 id="data-visualization">Data visualization</h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/data.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Some participants found the sleep data report page confusing, so we modified it to clarify
which day the user was currently on and added the option to change the way data was displayed.</p>
<h4 id="home-page-display">Home page display</h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/homepage.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The original design had an animal avatar as a method to communicate current progress to the
user in a concise and generalizable manner. Participants found the animal confusing. We changed
the prototype to use a person or animoji avatar instead but recognized that further discussion
was needed on this feature.</p>
<h4 id="information-search">Information search</h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/information.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Participants loved the feature to search for sleep tips and music, but found the interface hard
to use, so we classified information in order to make finding information more intuitive.</p>
<h4 id="community-ranking-list">Community ranking list</h4>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/ranking.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Our original intention with the ranking list was to enable users to share their sleep habits
with others and to learn about how to improve their own sleep. Participants thought this
feature showed promise but shared too much personal information. We modified the feature to
aggregate data and display an overall score instead of specific sleep and wake times. We
additionally walked away from this with a greater focus on privacy.</p>
<h3 id="final-paper-prototype">Final Paper Prototype</h3>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/finalpaperprototype.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>These changes resulted in our final paper prototype.  Our final prototype is similar to the
original in many ways but our testing allowed us to refine it.  This created a more focused
interface and a more intuitive layout.</p>
<p>The first task of creating a live progress tracker is improved by the changes made to the
social page. A user can now share their progress without divulging major personal information.
A user wanting to improve their sleep habits can more effectively and efficiently find tips or
advice from others in the simplified and categorized explore page. The changes we made turned
the app into a more encouraging social space as well.</p>
<p>The improved explore page also ties into our second task of cultivating a relaxed mindset and
environment for better sleep. The changed explore page makes information on improving your
sleep environment more timely and convenient to access. Users will find it easier to share
and find information they need.</p>
<h3 id="digital-mockup">Digital Mockup</h3>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/userflow.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

<p>The home page greets the user and contains the information most commonly used in our app.

</p>
<p>The tabs at the bottom help the user navigate to different pages. The first of these is the
library page. This page displays information curated by Doze on sleep as well as tips and
recommendations by the community of users. A person hoping to improve their sleep can seek
help here. Information is categorized to make the interface intuitive and easy to navigate.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

<p>The second tab, the report page, shows the user the data that their pillow has collected on
their sleep. The user has multiple options for how the sleep data can be displayed. Helpful
tips can pop up if they are necessary or relevant given the user's current data. Using this
data a user gains greater understanding of their current state and Doze will encourage them
to act upon it and improve their sleep habits.</p>

</p>
<p>The group page hosts the social portion of the app. From here a user can create a group of
friends. The app avoids negative reinforcement, instead encouraging groups to work together
towards a group goal. Members can view each other's progress and encourage one another to
adopt healthy practices. The group page's design is centered on fostering healthy team
mentality to encourage conversation around sleep and positive feedback.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>The pillow page holds the controls for the smart pillow. The design is simple and intuitive
and allows the user to schedule alarms in advance or choose music to help them fall asleep.
The simplicity of the design prevents a user from needing their phone in the bedroom to
control their pillow.</p>
<p>In transitioning from a paper format to a digital one, a feature that was significantly
changed was the home page. We determined in earlier testing that an animal or human
avatar would feel weird for users, especially when dealing with low health. To encourage
healthy sleep habits, we removed the character and the HP bar, opting for a star rating
system to remove the discouraging negative reinforcement of our previous design. We
additionally modified the social networking page to reflect this change, making it
less of a competition and more of a team effort.</p>
<p>The digital mockup also goes into much greater detail than the paper prototypes. We
specify a central theme for color, font, and layout that was not explicitly decided
in paper prototypes or sketches.</p>
<p>The first task of creating a social progress tracker is greatly improved by these changes.
The group tab now focuses on team bonding and growth instead of competition. This change
significantly affects the way users interact with our app and encourages positive
conversations around sleep and self-care. The ranking system serves as a foundation
for this. The difference is subtle but can be illustrated by a simple example. Consider
someone new to the app or someone who falls out of good sleep habits. Our previous design
would show them low health warnings or a sad character, discouraging them from trying
harder and possibly pushing them away from our app. The new approach using positive
reinforcement encourages the user to continue trying and reach a new goal.</p>
<p>The second task of cultivate a relaxed mindset and environment for better sleep is
accomplished by our design's attention to tracking and data. Imagine a person trying
to improve their sleep. Our app communicates their sleep data clearly, but unlike other
existing solutions, Doze offers advice that is timely and relevant to the user's needs.
The user can additionally find help from the community in the explore tab. Information
in our app is readily available and organized intuitively, helping users achieve their
goals.</p>
<p>We aimed to create a design that would help college students develop healthier
sleep habits. This digital mockup combines all we have learned into a single interface
that accomplishes this goal.</p>

<!-- TODO tagline a healthy dog is a happy dog -->
<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>According to studies, approximately 60% of household dogs are overweight or obese. This is a problem because overweight dogs are at a higher risk of developing health issues and behavioral problems.</p>
<p>Our solution aims to empower dog owners to make better health decisions for their dogs by monitoring their dog’s weight and exercise, the two largest factors in obesity. Our design is made up of three components, an application, a collar clip on, and location tiles. The application is the main source of information for the dog owner where they can see all their dogs’ data. The collar clip on is essential for tracking the dogs location and exercise habits. This small device can be clipped on to any dog collar. The final component is location tiles that dog owners can place in locations of their choosing and that sends information to the application when a dog is near. Overall, our design is based on the fundamental idea that the more information a dog owner has, the better decisions they can make.</p>

<p>Once the user profile is set up and the owner is logged in, they can sync tiles to be able to track when their pet is in proximity of their food bowl by selecting Sync Tile on the main screen.

<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<h4 id="participants">Participants</h4>
<h5 id="participant-1">Participant 1</h5>
<p>Our first participant has two small dogs that are 3 and 5 years old. She was chosen because she could benefit from our design since one of her dogs has minor weight issues.</p>
<h5 id="participant-2">Participant 2</h5>
<p>We conducted our second usability test with the three girls from another group in the section. They were chosen because they have a good understanding of design and would be able to provide us some design suggestions.</p>
<h5 id="participant-3">Participant 3</h5>
<p>We conducted our last usability test with a 20-year old male that owns a 6-year old Golden Retriever of healthy weight. We chose this participant to make sure that users with healthy dogs could still benefit and utilize our proposed design.</p>
<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>
<p>To ensure we were going to get our design right, we used a combination of Heuristic Design and Usability Testing. We also received some Visual Critique feedback which helped to finalize our design.</p>
<p>Our team ran Heuristic Evaluations with two different groups of HCI students, and immediately after each test we fixed issues that had a Severity Rating of 3 or 4. We didn’t want these issues to continue creating major usability issues for each further test.
We siloed any problems that had lower Severity Ratings and then fixed those after all of the tests were performed. This isn’t the typical dynamic, but it was justified due to time constraints.</p>
<p>For our Usability Tests, we performed a quick demographic interview, then we answered any preliminary questions the participant had about the project and our design. We gave the user one task at a time.</p>
<p>Then, we informed the users about the scenarios they would complete the tasks in. We debriefed them with more detailed information about our design and goals. We also asked about how they think about our design and asked more follow-up questions about the negative incidents that occurred.</p>
<p>While we made significant changes to our testing process for Heuristic Evaluation, we found that sticking to the originally defined process for Usability Tests worked best for our team.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement">Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</h3>
<p>The four main issues that came out of the Heuristic Evaluations were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consistency and standards</p>
<p>An issue where we didn’t have a hamburger button on each screen, and we didn’t consistently show the specifics of that menu. So our team added that button to each screen, and also added a screen that showed the contents of that menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</p>
<p>An issue where we didn’t allow users to recover from or to diagnose errors, because there weren’t any warnings or guidance when tiles and collars had sync errors. We resolved this by adding those messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognition rather than recall</p>
<p>A problem where it wasn’t obvious enough whether a dog had enough exercise on a specific day, since numbers are bland. By including color screens in our paper prototype, we corrected this issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistency and standards</p>
<p>Lastly, we solved an issue where our layout was suggesting that syncing a tile was a similar task as tracking food or tracking exercise. We moved the sync tile button to the hamburger menu to solve this issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There were also four main issues that came out of the Usability Tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participant 1 noted that the Sync button on the collar clip wasn’t obvious on the paper prototype. This likely is more of an issue with the medium we used for prototyping, but we made sure to label the button more obviously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participant 1 also wasn’t sure how to input the breed of one of her dogs. Her dog was a mixed-breed and our design didn’t clearly support the input of mixed-breed dogs. We corrected this by allowing the field more flexibility and by including a help button with a pop-up message for clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participant 1 also asked if we could prompt her to sync a tile immediately after syncing a collar. This is something we didn’t think about initially, but really helped get new users to be able to use the app more quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participants 2 and 3 noted that many of our labels were a bit too ambiguous, so we made changes throughout the app. One example is instead of using the term “Food” we changed it to “Food Data”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of mixed-breed support was a significant issue as only 5% of dogs in the US are purebred. This reduced the flexibility of our app which shrinks the population of participants that could use it. The workflow efficiency improvements and label and verbiage ambiguity were oversights by our design team, but participants who didn’t have the expert lens were able to find these quickly. One thing to note is that all participants were able to successfully complete the tasks which shows the advantages of having a simple design.</p>

<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>Tom is a second-year student in college. He has a three-year-old mixed breed of golden retriever and husky named Brooklyn, who is severely overweight. The veterinarian told Tom to make sure Brooklyn gets enough exercise and eats no more than 800 calories per day. Tom starts to wonder how he could keep track and monitor Brooklyn’s exercise amount. Tom finds Feedo online.</p>
<p>He downloads the mobile application, and collar clip and location tiles are sent to him the next day. He put the collar clip on Brooklyn’s collar and the location tile on bowl. When Tom opens the app, he gets to the start page (Figure 1) and is asked to either sign in or create an account. Tom creates an account (Figure 2) and Brooklyn’s profile (Figure 3). He doesn’t know how to describe the breed because Brooklyn’s a mixed-breed. He clicks on the help button (Figure 3) and a message shows up to guide him to select the two breeds that Brooklyn is mixed of (Figure 4). Then, the app asks him to sync the collar clip with the phone (Figure 5). A successful connected message is shown (Figure 6).</p>
<p>Then, the app continues to ask Tom to sync a location tile (Figure 7). Tom enters the location of the tile (Figure 8) and starts syncing (Figure 9), and a confirmation message is shown (Figure 10). Now, Tom goes to the main page (Figure 11) and clicks on “Exercise Data” to see how far and how many steps Brooklyn has walked today (Figure 12). A month later, Tome clicks on “See Monthly Overview” to see how Brooklyn did over the last month (Figure 13). According to the color-coded calendar, Brooklyn did great (a lot of green squares).</p>
<p>Everyday, Tom goes to the food tracking page (Figure 16) via “Food Data” (Figure 14) and taps “Tracking” which gives him the data (Figure 15). He could see when Brooklyn has been eating and whether she has run to the neighbor’s house and asked for treats. Tom also puts the dog food brand into the recommendation page (Figure 18) and gives Brooklyn the amount of food recommended by the app. A month later, Brooklyn is back to being a happy and healthy dog.</p>
<h4 id="changes">Changes</h4>
<p>In the paper prototype, on the main page, a drop-down menu shows after clicking on the hamburger menu. However, we change it to a full-length menu that slides from the side, as it is more conventional. The bigger the target, the less likely a mistake will be made.</p>

</p>
<p>The second change is on the food tracking page. Originally, it only had multiple lines of time and location data. We want to change the systematic look and add images, because images are more pre-attentive than words. This will reduce the memory load for users.</p>

<ng-template #designprototyping_fridgigotchi>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We started our design research aiming to determine how best to improve sustainable eating habits in America. Through interviews with an expert in sustainability, a chef at a sustainable restaurant, and a college student with interest in eating more sustainably, we determined that helping people reduce their food waste would be the most effective approach. Statistics show that food waste costs the US billions of dollars per year and is a major source of methane released into the atmosphere. Additionally, our interviews showed a greater willingness to reduce food waste than any other method of improving sustainability identified in our research, such as cutting out red meat or buying locally from more expensive farms.</p>
<p>There are two major causes of food waste identified in our design research that we aimed to address. The first is that people simply overstock their fridge and do not get around to eating their perishables until they have already spoiled. The second is that people sometimes need help figuring out what to do with the produce they buy, such as when one of our interviewees bought kale to be healthy but ended up finding it inedible. With these themes in mind we developed Fridgigotchi, a refrigerator attachment that keeps track of the food that is currently stocked and warns when food is close to spoiling, as well as allowing people to search for recipes with what they currently have in stock. This keeps people from forgetting what they have in their fridge until it spoils and inspires them to actually eat what they stock.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>Our interface has two parts: a touch screen that acts as a visual inventory, and a scanner for scanning receipts to add more items (the small strip below).</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image34.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="adding-items-to-and-removing-items-from-fridgigotchi">Adding Items to and Removing Items from Fridgigotchi</h4>
<p>A person can tap a button to manually add items to the inventory if the items do not come with a receipt.  The manual entry option has a keyboard for typing item names, which are then searched up on the internet, which the person can select from.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image20.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image31.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The other way a person can add items to the inventory by scanning a receipt.  The scanner reads the text on the receipt and automatically draws the items on the screen.  Before confirming that the item should be added on the screen, the person has a chance to edit the item’s display name.  When a new item is added the technology estimates its expiration, and stores how long it has left.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image11.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image35.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The items now appear in the main interface, along with health bars indicating the status of the food, as calculated by the technology.  When the person uses a food, in this case the tomato, they drag it off the screen.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image4.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="using-food-before-it-spoils">Using Food Before it Spoils</h4>
<p>If a person wants to figure out how to use foods before they expire, they can drag items to the “get recipes” plate in the lower left corner of the screen to get recommendations for this combination.  In this case, the person has moved yogurt and strawberries into the plate to get a recommendation.
After inputting the food items, this person gets recipe recommendations with the combination of strawberry and yogurt. The person can click the recipe they are interested in for more information.</p>

<h4 id="figuring-out-what-needs-to-be-discarded">Figuring out what needs to be discarded</h4>
<p>After one week, the fridge is getting worried because many foods including broccoli, lemon, carrot and tomato in the fridge are expiring soon.  We can tell which foods are going bad because their health bars are lowering.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image3.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>If someone is interested in the status of a food, in this case broccoli, they can tap it for more details.  A pop-up shows up with information on how many days the broccoli has and asks for confirmation if the person has used it.  The popup warns that the broccoli is starting to spoil.  Since the person has not eaten the broccoli yet, they tap “no”, exiting the pop-up.</p>

<p>After another week, the person gets a popup saying that the broccoli is now probably spoiled, and that they should probably discard it.</p>

<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<p>With our paper prototype finished, we were ready to move on to the testing phase. We conducted 4 tests in total: one heuristic test then three usability tests.</p>
<h4 id="heuristic-evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
<p>Heuristic evaluations are a way of detecting obvious design flaws that violate common design heuristics. The specific heuristics we tested against were Nielsen’s 10 design heuristics as they were outlined in class.</p>
<p>Our heuristic evaluation was conducted in class with two classmates from a different group. Our participants, Amy and Beth, were both junior CSE students, neither of which reported too much prior interest in eating sustainably. However, since this was conducted in class with all groups needing testers, we felt that screening participants for being in our target audience would be prohibitively difficult and decided to continue with the test. We started by first introducing Fridgigotchi to our testers, describing its purpose and the general tasks that we aimed to solve with it. We then presented the paper prototype to our testers and asked them to attempt to walkthrough the system and get a feel for how it works. We encouraged them to look for heuristics violations with regards to the general flow and feel of the design. Once they felt fairly comfortable with how the paper prototype worked, we asked them to go through the design again, this time with a focus on more specific, element wise heuristic violations. This was the last part of the test, and we thanked them for their help. After the test had concluded, we rated the severity of each issue found on a scale from 0 (non-issue) to 4 (critical usability issue) and the ease of fixing the issue on a scale of 1 (near impossible) to 4 (trivial to fix). With this information aggregated, we discussed which revisions needed to be made and changed the paper prototype accordingly.</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-protocol">Usability Test Protocol</h4>
<p>Our protocol for usability testing was to first interview possible participants about their attitudes toward food waste. More specifically, we asked whether or not they have taken any conscious action to reduce food waste or have thought about their food waste in any way before the interview. If the participant answers yes to either of the two questions, we considered them part of Fridgigotchi’s target audience and continued with the usability test. We then introduced Fridgigotchi and a more detailed idea of how we intended to conduct our usability test, being sure to emphasize that they should feel free to point out any critiques they think of and to think out loud as they move through the prototype. They were then given three tasks: add food, both from a receipt and manually, into Fridgigotchi, search for recipes containing the food that was just input, and delete foods that have been finished. Once those tasks were completed, we asked for any final thoughts from the participant, then thanked them for their time.</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-1">Usability Test 1</h4>
<p>We conducted our first usability test with a junior CSE student. She noticed that she tends to create a lot of food waste recently, primarily due to her parents giving her food on a weekly basis but never spending enough time home to eat it. Rather than store it and deal with figuring out how to use it later, she tends to throw it away out of convenience. Fridgigotchi is intended to solve exactly these kinds of problems, so we chose this participant given she’s part of the target audience. The usability test was conducted in the Gates Center Undergraduate Commons. The paper prototype was laid out on an ottoman with our participant sitting in front of it. This space had some other CS undergrads present which made it less than ideal for conducting our usability test, but it was sufficiently quiet that we decided not to move. We also considered moving to a location with a fridge, but we did not want to be disturbed by people actually using the fridge. We were able to conduct the entire test uninterrupted. Ian was the facilitator, with Josh serving as the computer and Savanna as the observer.</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-2">Usability Test 2</h4>
<p>We conducted our second usability test with a senior HCDE student who we shared HCI section with. This section was dedicated to getting every group in section another usability test, so we did not do the same vetting of participants or environments that we would otherwise. We conducted the study in the section classroom in Mary Gates Hall for everyone’s convenience.
We still asked our food waste questions, and she said that while she has heard that food waste was a serious issue and considered making changes in the past, she has not thought about it recently or made any lasting changes. This test was conducted with Ian as the facilitator and computer and Savanna as the observer.</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-3">Usability Test 3</h4>
<p>Our third usability test was conducted with a junior CSE student in a research study room in the Gates Center. We used the gates center because it was where we could meet with our participants most easily, and the research study room was quiet. The participant herself was picked because she had actively tried to eat more sustainably through going vegetarian, and was open to making other changes. This test was conducted with Ian as the facilitator, Josh as the computer, and Vanessa as the observer.</p>
<h4 id="testing-retrospective">Testing Retrospective</h4>
<p>One of the most important refinements we made was to our introduction to the tests. When we did tests with people from within class who understood how the test worked, we did not find too much introduction to the testing process necessary as they already knew their task and had some familiarity with Fridgigotchi. Tests with people outside the class however could be more challenging, and we had some participants who did not seem comfortable thinking out loud or exploring the prototype. Once we noticed this, we put more emphasis in the introduction that there are no wrong answers and to share whatever thoughts that they had. We also originally planned to test with the paper prototype on an actual refrigerator in a real-life setting. Ultimately, we found our implementation of this with tape tedious and slow to operate, so we decided to keep the paper prototype on tables.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement">Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</h3>
<p>Our heuristic evaluation, usability tests and design critique introduced some significant design issues that we later corrected to greatly improve the design. In this process, we learned some useful design practices. These were organized into these major themes:</p>
<h4 id="theme-1-promote-positive-reinforcement-and-real-world-match">Theme 1: Promote positive reinforcement and real world match</h4>
<p><strong>Issues #1: Negative reinforcement from eating food before it spoils</strong>
Through the usability test, we learned that our participants felt bad when they drag away happy foods. This was a huge problem in the design since one of our main goals in the product is to encourage people to eat food before it spoils If people wait until the foods get sad before consuming them, this defeats the purpose of Fridgigotchi.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image4.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Before in our initial paper prototype design, people felt sad when consuming their food. Thus, our first change was to prevent negative reinforcement by removing the faces from foods, making consuming food an emotionally neutral experience.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image21.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image24.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>After discovering the issues, in our final paper prototype, we removed faces from foods to solve the problem. People do not get sad anymore from consuming their food!</p>
<p><strong>Issue # 2: Missing logic match between system and real world of ‘fridge’ and lack of positive reinforcement</strong>
We had originally had a fridge character who was on the screen with the foods with faces, and the foods would get consumed by the fridge. Through tests, we realized that our system did not logically match the real world. Consuming food was represented by dragging them into a fridge character, when in reality these foods were being taken out of a real-world fridge and eaten.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image9.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Before the change, feeding the fridge confuses users.
Thus, we decided to remove the fridge character from our system and looked for a new character who  promotes positive reinforcement to replace him. Therefore, we found Snorlax, a big friendly character with a big appetite.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image42.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>We replaced the fridge with Snorlax to solve the problem and it got carried out into our digital design.</p>
<h4 id="theme-2-communicate-a-clear-message">Theme 2: Communicate a clear message</h4>
<p><strong>Issue #3: Confusing health bar design</strong>
Different foods have different fridge lifetimes, and one week left may be one food’s entire shelf life, while one week left may be one tenth of another food’s lifetime. Participants found the health bars difficult to read and gain insights from.  Therefore, we replaced them with text showing things like “4 days left” or “1 week left”.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image23.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Before the change, it was very difficult for people to tell which foods were expiring first based on the health bar.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image6.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image5.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>After the change, we replaced health bars with the number of days left to solve the problem, which was carried into our final digital design.</p>
<h3 id="final-paper-prototype">Final Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>Here is an overview of the final paper prototype:</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image33.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Our interface has two parts: a touch screen that acts as a visual inventory, and a scanner for scanning receipts to add more items (the small strip below).</p>
<h4 id="adding-items-to-and-removing-items-from-fridgigotchi-2">Adding Items to and Removing Items from Fridgigotchi</h4>
<p>A person can press a button to manually add items to the inventory if the items do not come with a receipt.  The manual entry option has a keyboard for typing item names, which are then searched up on the internet, which the person can select from.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image30.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image8.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The other way a person can add items to the inventory by scanning a receipt.  The scanner reads the text on the receipt and displays what it thinks each item is.  The person then has a chance to review the items being added and make changes, especially on items with information the scanner struggled to autofill. If the user doesn’t want to process an item right now, they can save it for later.  Before confirming that the item should be added on the screen, the person has a chance to edit the item’s display name and image.  When a new item is added the technology estimates its expiration, and stores how long it has left.  The person can edit this too.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image14.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image28.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The items now appear in the main interface, along with counters indicating the number of days left in the food, as calculated by the given expiration dates.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>When the person has consumed an item, they can either drag it off the screen or give it to Snorlax to eat.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image24.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="using-food-before-it-spoils-2">Using Food Before it Spoils</h4>
<p>If a person wants to figure out how to use foods before they expire, they can drag items to the “get recipes” plate in the lower left corner of the screen to get recommendations for this combination.  In this case, the person has moved yogurt and strawberries into the plate to get a recommendation. “Show Recipes” appears as a user drags items onto the get recipes section.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image10.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Now after inputting the food items, this person gets recipe recommendations with the combination of strawberry and yogurt. The person can click the recipe they are interested in for more information and watch a video of the creation.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image41.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="figuring-out-what-needs-to-be-discarded-2">Figuring out what needs to be discarded</h4>
<p>One Week later, broccoli and lemon in the fridge are expiring soon.  We can tell which foods are going bad because their pictures have smell lines coming out of them.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image21.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The person is interested in the status of the lemon and taps it to see more detail.  A pop-up shows up after clicking in  with information on how many days the lemon has and asks for confirmation if the person has used it.  The popup also has information from the internet on what indications to look for to see if the lemon has gone bad.  In this case, it is brown spots on the lemon.  The popup warns that the lemon is starting to spoil.  The person clicks “no” since they haven’t used up the lemon yet.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image15.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Days later, the person gets a popup saying that the lemon is now probably spoiled, and that they should probably discard it.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image19.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="digital-mockup">Digital Mockup</h3>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image39.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Our design now takes on the form of a touch screen that acts as an interactive visual inventory</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image18.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>A person can press a button to manually add items to the inventory if the items do not come with a receipt.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image43.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>A person can press a button to manually add items to the inventory if the items do not come with a receipt.  The manual entry option has a keyboard for typing item names, which are then searched up on the internet, which the person can select from.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image27.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The person can add items to the inventory by opening the camera and taking a picture of a receipt. The camera reads the text on the receipt and automatically draws the items on the screen.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image32.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The person then has a chance to review the items being added and make changes, especially on items with information the scanner struggled to autofill. If the user doesn’t want to process an item right now, they can save it for later.  Before confirming that the item should be added on the screen, the person has a chance to edit the item’s display name and image.  When a new item is added the technology estimates its expiration, and stores how long it has left.  The person can edit this too.

<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image44.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>When the person has used an item, in this case broccoli, they can drag it off the screen or feed it to Snorlax.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image26.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="using-food-before-it-expires">Using Food Before it Expires</h4>
<p>If a person wants to figure out how to use foods before they expire, they can drag items to the “get recipes” plate in the lower left corner of the screen to get recommendations for this combination.  In this case, the person has moved yogurt and strawberries into the plate to get a recommendation. “Show Recipes” appears as a user drags items onto the get recipes section.</p>

<p>Now after inputting the food items, this person gets recipe recommendations for their desired combination. The person can click the recipe they are interested in for more information and to watch a video of the recipe.  For interest in a particular recipe, the person can click the video to play on a larger screen and to see more details.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image25.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

<h4 id="knowing-what-food-to-discard">Knowing What Food to Discard</h4>
<p>One Week later, broccoli, chicken leg, cheese and tomato are expiring soon and it is obvious from the shadow on their icons and Snorlax’s worried face.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image40.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The person is interested in the status of the broccoli and taps it to see more detail.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>A pop-up shows up after clicking in with information on how many days the broccoli has and asks for confirmation if the person has used it.  The popup also has information from the internet on what indications to look for to see if the broccoli has gone bad.  The popup warns that the broccoli is starting to spoil.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image22.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The person has not used the broccoli yet, so they click “no”</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image36.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Days later the person gets a popup saying that the broccoli is now probably spoiled and that they should probably discard it.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/image29.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="changes-from-paper-to-digital-prototype">Changes from paper to digital prototype</h4>
<p>We decided to change how people upload food from their receipts. Originally we had a separate scanner attached that people would scan barcodes and receipts into. After gathering people’s feedback, we realize this extra scanner component increases the cost and difficulty for users to adopt our product. Instead, we decided to let people scan directly through a device camera, making our product cheap, convenient and adaptable to many devices.
In addition, we also darkened the icons of spoiled or near-spoiled foods to make it more obvious that these foods need attention. Originally this was done by drawing the icons with a “smell”, but in the digital mockup, this was less distinguishing.</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>In situations of Intimate Partner Abuse, abusers will often utilize the internet/home network as one of their methods of exercising control over their partner. We are addressing the information asymmetry this creates between abuser and survivor by providing the survivor information about how a network is being utilized in the context of their privacy and security. With access to this information, we look to empower the user with an understanding of how control is being exercised over them, potentially leading them to discreetly find resources to help them out of their situation.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>As our UI is primarily an information delivery system, in our initial paper prototype we explored all of the information we could deliver to the user through the information collected by our HUB device. Below is an overview of the prototype:</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/paper_overview.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Our first task was to check the constant feed of device activity. This provided the user a log of all interaction with IoT and non-IoT devices so they could see the activity happening on the network.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/paper_task1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Our second task was to perform a cybersecurity analysis on a user's network and devices. The results of this were divided into four categories: Device security, Network security, Data security, and Application security. Alerts and notifications would be sent out after performing the analysis.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/paper_task2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The Device security section contained a personalized interface we called the Device HUB, which represented an IoT web. It included icons for each device on the network. Each device could be selected to find more info on that device and its activity, allowing users to delve deeper into the security conditions of each device. We provided indications of which devices were compromised using exclamation marks next to the corresponding devices.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/paper_device_security.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Network security was further subdivided into three categories: WIFI Security, IP Protection and Anti-tamper and Detection Security. Similarly to the Device HUB under Device security, each sub-category in network security had indications of the level of security, and each sub-category could be selected to see more information about it.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/paper_network_security.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 250px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Continuing the trend, the Data security and Application security sections had progress-bar style indicators of security for each data category and application on the user's devices. These sections would also provide the user with notifications and alerts regarding suspicious activity which would provide additional information on the suspicious activity. These notifications and alerts would also provide the user with suggestions with how to handle the event.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/paper_data_security.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/paper_app_security.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<p>Our testing process was rather simple and relatively unstructured. Since the UI aspect of our design is primarily an information delivery system, our goal for our testing was to refine our UI down into the most intuitive and effective information delivery system we could make it. All our tests involved us giving a quick briefing on what our design is and what the UI portion of it served as, then setting the participants loose on our design starting from either the home screen or a notification on the lock screen and seeing how they navigated it, interacted with it, and how they reacted to the information presenting to them.
We had four participants. Our first two participants, a security proxy who had some security issues in their past and one of our classmates, performed the tests on our initial paper prototype. The third participant, our resident expert who co-wrote a paper strongly related to our problem space, was given our first full digital prototype of our UI. The fourth participant, a target end-user, tested the modified version of our digital prototype resulting from the third user test.
During each test, we asked the participants to “think out loud” as they navigated the design so we could get a gauge on what aspects made sense to them and what aspects were confusing. This was particularly true of our first, second, and fourth user tests. For our third test with the expert, we asked for a more expert analysis of everything in our design. Since they viewed our first digital prototype, this included wording on menu options and buttons, information delivery via color, ease of navigation, etc.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement">Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</h3>
<p>Our first two user tests yielded rather straightforward results: the UI was confusing, it was unclear how one was meant to navigate it or what to do with it, and there was too much information, making it difficult to interpret what everything meant.</p>
<p>At this point, instead of making many changes to the paper prototype, we decided to immediately begin work on a digital version of our prototype. We did so in anticipation of our third user test being more of an expert evaluation, making us want to present a more refined-looking version of our prototype while also beginning to more easily explore how color could be used to convey information in our design. Furthermore, the third test was performed remotely, so being able to send the third participant a link to a digital prototype that could transition between screens made things run much more smoothly than holding up pieces of paper to a camera to transition between screens. Below is the first version of our digital prototype.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/digital1_homescreen.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">

</p>
<p>The first screen was our home screen. The second screen was linked to by the “Interaction History” button on the home screen. The third screen was linked to by its respective button on the home screen, as well as the fourth screen.
The idea behind this was to simplify down the control flow of the app and consolidate information down into a few more discrete categories while reducing information overload.</p>
<p>Our third participant provided plenty of feedback on this design, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the words/terminology used were too technical and could be intimidating to someone who is unfamiliar with the terms</li>
<li>The use of colors to divide categories and also provide severity information was confusing and at times seemed contradictory in an intuitive sense</li>
<li>The categorization of security events was unnecessary and could be a barrier to entry if the user doesn’t fully grasp the differences between the categories</li>
<li>The interaction log seemed unnecessary with the existence of the vulnerability analysis page</li>
<li>The most important information, such as what was presented on the vulnerability analysis page, could be made more easily/readily accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this feedback, we decided to essentially turn our vulnerability analysis page into the home page. This home page would present events as the HUB device collects information, and there would be options to learn more about each event should a user want to inform themselves further than just the short summary presented on the home screen. Below is the original vulnerability analysis page and the new home page which shares a similar design. On this new home page we also used simpler language that still conveys the information we want to present.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>The “learn more” button in each event’s box leads to screens like the ones below. Here we present the user with more information on each event, as well as providing suggestions on how to handle the event. Some of the screens displayed are full examples, while others are more of templates.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

<p>Finally, the buttons in the top corners of the home screen lead to the screens below, where we provide information about the limitations of our design as well as the significance of the colors on the home screen.</p>

<p>This was the UI presented to our fourth participant, who’s test went quite smoothly. They believed our design to be intuitive to use. However, they did mention that the order/filter buttons on the home screen were confusing as two of them were just different orderings and the third was an ordering with a filter. We changed those to be separate order and filter drop down menus to eliminate that confusion.</p>

</p>
<p>From our third user test onwards, we made a concerted effort to present nearly all information to the user in plain english. We realized that having scoring systems that either gave the user numerical scores or partially filled progress bars depending on the level of security was confusing and arbitrary. The less the aspects of our UI had to be learned or be explained to the user, the more effective and understandble our information delivery could become. Anything in our design from this point onward that relied in some way on a system that determined the severity of a situation using numbers would first be translated into some more easily understandble form - namely the certainty scores on the &quot;learn more&quot; pages and the per-event colors on the home page. We made sure to also explain the colors we used, and kept that as the only information delivery aspect that isn't directly in english, greatly reducing the number of things in our design that could create confusion.</p>
<h3 id="final-prototype-mockup">Final Prototype/Mockup</h3>
<p>Our user testing resulted in a major refinement in our information delivery within our design. From an initial design with all the information we could think of categorized and divided into different sections to one where all the information is much more centralized and there is no information presented to the user that is more than a single finger press or mouse click away from the home screen.</p>
<p>With our changes to our design also came changes to our two primary tasks. Our two new tasks became:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the feed of security events</li>
<li>Learn more about a specific security event</li>
</ul>
<p>The first task is performed simply by opening the app. Since our home screen became the primary source of information delivery, the most pertinent and most summarized information is presented to the user there through the feed of security events. Below are examples of the home screen in a few different orderings as well as one filter, though all present the same overall informationa and have the same events as elements that make up the feed.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/final_digital_home1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">

  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/final_digital_home4.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>
<p>The second task is performed by hitting the &quot;learn more&quot; button on any one event on the home screen's feed. Doing so will lead the user to a screen like the one below.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/digital3_search_history.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>
<p>This example corresponds to the event on the home page with the same summary in red text as the &quot;learn more&quot; page has in its top red box. This is where the user can gain a better understanding of what the information presented on their home feed means in a more detailed and explained form. It is also here that they can find suggestions on how to handle the event.</p>
<p>Below are more examples of the final &quot;learn more&quot; pages. Like before, there are fleshed out examples and templates.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/digital3_failed_login.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">

</p>
<p>Should the user be confused about what the colors on the home screen mean, they can use the corresponding option on the home page that will lead them to the screen giving them that information.</p>

TODO tagline: productivity with intention
--> 
<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>Smartphone use is more prevalent than ever before. With every update, people are becoming more and more invested in their virtual lives. Their work life, social life, and down time appear to all revolve around one device which has instant access to all of the world’s collective information. However, instead of using their phone as a productive tool, many people seem to have an unhealthy relationship with their device. We wanted to get to the root of this relationship and understand why phones aren’t being used to maximize different areas of people’s lives to their fullest potential.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Initially, we thought that our problem lied in excessive phone usage, but we found that instead the problem was with unintentional phone usage.</p>
<p>As we talked to more and more individuals, both within and outside the college sphere, there was a theme that came up time and time again. Balance. People struggle with balancing productivity and entertainment within their professional and personal lives. We realized that smartphones already come with multiple ways to monitor your phone usage, yet many choose to either not look at their data or purposefully ignore it. Our app aims to make this data more visible in both passive and active forms.</p>
<p>Our app <em>mode</em> utilizes a plant visual as a passive tracker of phone usage. As an individual operates their phone in work mode, or is not on their phone at all, the plant will begin to flourish. As they in turn begin to unconsciously scroll on apps such as social media, the plant then begins to wither and die. The plant then serves as a visual measurement between a user and their screen time data.</p>
<p>Through our app <em>mode</em>, individuals can find a better balance between work and play. Instead of eliminating the smartphone entirely, <em>mode</em> allows you to use your phone with intention rather than distraction.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>After we decided to focus on the unintentional phone usage problem, we started to build our first prototype based off the experiences of our participants in the design research phase.</p>
<h4 id="task-1">Task 1</h4>
<p>For our first task, we asked the user to add Instagram to the play mode and slack to work mode. Users do so by entering the mode app and clicking the setting button. Afterwards, they can edit their modes according to which apps they would like in each category to customize the app to their needs.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1-1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1-2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="task-2">Task 2</h4>
<p>For the second task, we asked the user to scroll through Instagram, keep an eye on their plant, and act accordingly. As they figure out that the plant is wilting due to their Instagram usage as a result of Instagram being in play mode, users switch to work mode or turn their phone off until their plant is revived.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task2-1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task2-2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<p>Our testing process allowed us to consistently iterate on the initial paper prototype, fixing small mistakes that led to big changes.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/testing_process.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>We initially performed two separate low-risk heuristic evaluations to quickly identify obvious problems in our initial design. Through our heuristic evaluations, we found many small issues such as missing back buttons, internal inconsistencies with headers, and confusion between buttons.</p>
<p>By fixing these issues before the usability tests, we were able to remove design flaws before the user focused in on them. This allowed for finding major structural issues during our usability tests.</p>
<p>We then conducted the three usability tests. We asked each participant to complete two separate tasks critical to the functionality of <em>mode</em>.</p>
<p>We broke down our usability test down to our participant doing the task and reflecting on the action. After each task we asked them a series of questions to better understand how they reasoned through the task and if there were any unintuitive features that we had designed.</p>
<p>Here we were able to identify bigger problems with our design, and found that several key aspects were not intuitive as the walk-up-and-use technology that we wanted. From our usability tests, we were able to create a final paper prototype that was much more straightforward and friendly to our testers and easily translated to the digital space as a mockup.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement">Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</h3>
<p>After discovering pain points and confusion, we worked with our participants to brainstorm solutions to our issues. The problems that we found with our design includes confusion navigating different app features and difficulty finding the switch to change modes.</p>
<p>When we first administered the tasks, the first two participants had no idea how to perform them without exploration. We did our best to refrain from giving them key information, but they asked anyway. This wasn’t an issue during the heuristic evaluation when the evaluator was exploring functionality; it was only an issue when participants were asked to do specific things. To fix this disconnect, we added a brief tutorial for certain key functions that plays when you use the app for the first time and tested this with the third participant. The first task ran more smoothly, although he had a couple of suggestions for the tutorial to make it even more clear, which we have since refined.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/proto_walkthrough.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>We also decided to rearrange the app into panels for a more intuitive layout. The many buttons were slightly confusing, especially when hand drawn, so panels broke apart the information. This is also a common iOS convention within apps, so participants easily figured out that the panels could be swiped due to the addition of the dots at the bottom indicating which panel you were on.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/panels.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Participants did not know at all how to switch modes. After the first two usability tests, we added an option to include the iOS <em>mode</em> “widget” accessible from the home screen by swiping right that provided a simple interface that only displayed which mode you were currently in and a switch for switching modes. This worked well for the third participant, but he was an Android user, and only knew how to access the widget this way with a hint. If this were to be actually implemented, we would still be able to create an Android widget, but we decided to also put a switch on the launch page of the Mode app that allows you to more clearly switch between modes. We don’t want switching to be too easy, because we wanted to enforce the idea of consciously shifting between modes to improve productivity rather than just when it is convenient.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/widget.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="final-paper-prototype">Final Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>Here you can see an overview of our entire final prototype, and you can see some of the changes we’ve made since the initial prototype, such as a tutorial and widget system.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/prototype_overview.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="task-1-2">Task 1</h4>
<p>With our final paper prototype, the settings page that allows you to add apps to each mode is now  dual indicated with both color and symbols. When testing this prototype, participants were able to understand how to add and remove apps without any help or questions. We also added the instant feedback mechanism that moves an app to its respective category as soon as a participant adds it or removes it, which allows the participant to see the system status at all times.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/final_task1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="task-2-2">Task 2</h4>
<p>Our prototype now takes advantage of widget features to actively switch between modes. As you can see, when a participant spends too much time on Instagram, for example, they get a notification asking them to check on the status of their plant. When they navigate to the home screen and see that their plant is wilting, they can simply swipe left and use the mode widget to switch between work and play mode, and continue by using their phone for work to revive their plant.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/final_task2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="digital-mockup">Digital Mockup</h3>
<p>For our digital mockups, we kept a lot of our designs and concepts from our final paper prototype. Overall, the transition from paper prototype to mockup was pretty straight forward and we were able to implement rough ideas that weren't clear to our participants due to the low-fidelity nature of our prototype. The biggest changes and decisions came from pain points in our usability tests and in class critique such as a more comprehensive tutorial, plant status rather than dying notifications, and better icons for readability.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/digital_overview.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="design-choices">Design Choices</h4>
<p>When translating our prototype to our digital mockup, we decided on keeping a minimal theme with as few distractions as possible to reflect the nature of our app. With this aesthetic came a color scheme of pastel and lowly saturated colors of indigo, blue, and green to replicate a calming effect. We also chose the font Roboto, as it is an easy to read sans serif font with several different weights. This makes it easy to pair with itself at different points within the app headers, buttons, and content.</p>
<p>We created a consistent template for each screen, and kept headers, back arrows, icons, etc. the same for internal consistency. Finally, we included dual indication for most visual aspects, such as red x's vs green plusses, or red down arrows vs green up arrows to increase accessibility features. If we had more time in this course, we would have liked to design for multiple operating systems, but for our mockup we stuck to iOS and its conventions.</p>
<p>We also added data visualization to some of the statistics, such as graphs and medals with personal bests, to created an easier way to see progress in terms of limiting phone usage.</p>
<h4 id="task-1-3">Task 1</h4>
<p>For the first task using our digital mockup, users should tap the settings gear, now located the top right. They then choose the edit button for the mode that they are adjusting, and click add icons for their respective apps.</p>
<p>Rather than including several small buttons close together as before, we have the most important features spread over panels in accordance with iOS conventions and the statistics page as a panel accessed by swiping right. Any page within the app has back buttons that are clearly readable and it is easy to see which page you are navigating back to, which is often the <em>mode</em> home screen.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/digital_task1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="task-2-3">Task 2</h4>
<p>For the second task of our digital mockup, users first navigate to Instagram. After scrolling through for a few hours, a status update pops up and informs the user on the current state of the plant. In seeing the plant wilting, the user changes to work mode or shuts off their phone entirely to revive their plant.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/digital_task2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Overall, this project has been through many iterations to best provide a productivity tool for the modern phone user.</p>

#### Capture life as it happens
-->
<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview:</h3>
<p>Capturing the precious moments during the trip is a common wish for most of the travellers. However, both taking photos of the scenes and remembering the happenings can be difficult to many people.
We want to design a mini camera and a mobile app to make it more convenient for travellers to capture those precious moments. They can easily take photos and take notes of happenings by talking to the camera. The mobile app would then support users to easily organize the memories, for example, by allowing quick deletion of duplicate photos.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype:</h3>
<p>Our prototype has two components. The first one is a wearable PinPoint camera that can be attached to clothing or a hat, it takes photos and adds descriptions to them using a voice command. The second component is a mobile app connected to the camera via Bluetooth; the app stores and organizes photos taken by PinPoint camera.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/1_1.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Figure 1.1 PinPoint camera prototype and relations between different screens in mobile app</p>
<h4 id="task-1-adding-descriptions-to-photos-at-the-moment-they-are-taken">Task 1: Adding descriptions to photos at the moment they are taken</h4>
<p>Selecting “Camera” on the “Settings” tab (fig. 1.2) takes the user to default camera settings (fig. 1.3).
The user switches “Bluetooth” toggle to connect the wearable camera and sees a pop-up window that device was successfully paired (fig. 1.4).
By clicking “Alert”, the user can select the volume of the sound, which sound to use when photo/notes were taken and whether to use vibration (fig. 1.5).
Selecting “Notes” on the “Settings” tab (fig. 1.2) takes the user to note settings (fig. 1.6).
There are options for notes autotranscription and keeping the original voice memo.
Selecting “Photos” on the “Settings” tab (fig. 1.2) takes the user to default photo settings (fig. 1.7).
Selecting “Take Photo” takes the user to default photo-taking routine. If “Auto” is selected, the user can choose the frequency of auto photo/note taking (fig. 1.8).
If the user wants photos/notes to be taken by voice command, the user should set up it. The user clicks “Set up taking photos” and sees pop-up notification (fig. 1.9).
When the user clicks “Continue”, the new pop-up window is displayed, and the app records command to be used for taking photos (fig. 1.10).
The “command successfully set up” notification is shown and the user can proceed taking photos via voice command (fig. 1.11).
The exact same routine happens when the user selects “Set up taking notes”.
When those set-ups are done, the user can take photos and record notes whenever he/she wants. For example, the user wears a PinPoint camera and goes hiking. When he see bears, he just says command and camera takes photos and notes.</p>

<h4 id="task-2-organizing-deleting-duplicate-pictures">Task 2: Organizing/deleting duplicate pictures</h4>
<p>The user selects the “Gallery” tab and sees recently added photos; burst photos and photos with notes have a pile of photos symbol or voice symbol respectively (fig. 1.12). When the user selects the group of the same photos (burst) with added voice memo, the user can scroll bottom field to see each photo from the series of photos (fig. 1.13). If the user doesn’t want to manually choose the best photo from each group, the user can go back to “Settings” (fig. 1.2), and select “Auto delete” on “Photos” tab (fig. 1.7). The user can change the maximum number of photos taken per one command and switch toggle to allow app analysis and keeping only the best photo from the whole series (fig.1.14). When the user returns back to the “Gallery”, the user sees only the best-quality photos (fig. 1.15).</p>

<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process:</h3>
<h4 id="inspection-based-method">Inspection-based method:</h4>
<p>We did our first round of testing by asking fellow classmates to perform heuristic evaluations of our product. We gave them some introduction of our product and asked them to evaluate our product based on Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics. This helped us quickly identify some usability problems before approaching real users.</p>
<h4 id="usability-test">Usability test:</h4>
<p>After we refined our paper prototype based on the heuristic evaluation results, we did three rounds of usability tests and quickly iterated our design after each test.
Our first usability test was with Tim, a 21 year old student at the UW, which falls squarely in our target demographic. Tetiana served as the app, Josh served as the note taker, and Fengwei served as the facilitator. We gave a brief introduction of our product, then asked the participant to perform a series of tasks. We found that in this test, we had to provide quite a bit of background information before Tim was able to navigate through the tasks. We decided to add more context in the form of initial setup screens, which should allow for more user autonomy in future tests.
Our second usability test was with Catherine, a student at the UW. This time we provided more introduction about the basic product features, so that the participant had the same level of knowledge as a person who buys the product. This introduction, and the initial setup screens we added after the first usability test, allowed the participant to more easily navigate through our product. The participant was able to focus on the specific details of the product, such as confusion about some wordings.
Our third usability test was with Jenna. This time we tried to ask more questions during and after the test. This stimulated the participant to think about their own past experiences and give more useful feedback about the product by imagining using it in a real life situation. Asking the participant for comments or suggestions at the end of the test also allowed our participant to think about the big picture of the product and give more high-level feedback.</p>

<p>The functionality of “Take Photo” isn’t clear. The user might think it’s actual photo taking instead of set-up functionality.

<p style="text-align: center">Figure 2.3</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-2">Usability test</h4>
<p>Our usability tests identified several major problems and led to a few major modifications:</p>
<h5 id="initial-setup-of-camera-functions">Initial setup of camera functions</h5>
<p>To eliminate confusion for the first time users and improve discoverability of functions, we thought it is very important to add an initial setup process to help get their preferred settings before starting to use the camera. This setup process is displayed in the final prototype task 1 section.</p>
<h5 id="handling-duplicate-photos-and-photo-deletion">Handling duplicate photos and photo deletion</h5>
<p>Our first participant had some difficulty distinguishing between deleting the entire series of photos versus deleting only some photos out of a series. We thought about the experience that we wanted to provide with our app, which is to create an app that makes recording memories as simple as possible. With this goal in mind, we decided to remove the ability to take a series of photos completely. Now, each time a photo is taken, a series of photos are taken but the best photo is automatically selected and saved, so the user never has to interact with deleting ‘duplicate’ photos.</p>
<h5 id="taking-a-photo-and-taking-a-voice-memo">Taking a photo and taking a voice memo</h5>
<p>Participants asked about whether users can take photos and voice memos separately, can they be taken together with a single command, and how to end taking a voice memo. These urged us to think about more details regarding the design of our mini camera:
Photos and voice memos can be taken separately: this would allow users to be more flexible and keep more memories during their trip. We also iterated our app design to support displaying standalone audio notes.
Various ways to stop recording a voice memo: firstly, users can say a voice command to stop recording. Since users may forget to say the command, we also design the camera to stop recording after 15 seconds of silence. Given the situation that the environment is noisy, we also allow the camera to force stop recording after 5 minutes.</p>
<h5 id="gallery-displaying-the-memories-without-photos-attached">Gallery displaying the memories without photos attached</h5>
<p>A very interesting point mentioned by one participant was that the gallery in the app has not much difference from the normal album in the mobile phones. Since our product is mainly used to help take photos and voice memos when traveling, users expect the app to display not only the photos but the memories along the trip. We thus changed our gallery in the app to display the photos and the transcribed voice memo in a timeline (fig. 2.4). We felt that this would allow us to be more specific to our target users, and allow users to be clearer about the focus and unique selling point of the product.</p>

<h3 id="final-paper-prototype">Final Paper Prototype:</h3>
<p>Our prototype has two components. The first one is a wearable PinPoint camera that can be attached to clothing or a hat, it takes photos and description to them using a voice command. The second component is a mobile app connected to the camera via Bluetooth; it stores and organizes photos taken by PinPoint camera.</p>

<h4 id="task-1-taking-photos-and-adding-descriptions-immediately">Task 1: Taking photos and adding descriptions immediately</h4>
<p>When the user uses the app for the first time, the user is guided through all required setup (fig 3.2). At the beginning, the user pairs the camera with a phone app (fig. 3.3-3.4). Then, the user chooses whether to take photos automatically between some intervals or to use voice command (fig. 3.5). In the next step, the user sets up the voice command to take a photo (fig. 3.7-3.9). After that, the user sets up the voice command to record the voice memos (fig. 3.10-3.12). Finally, the user sets up an alert to use after the photo/note was taken (fig. 3.13). When those set-ups are done, the user can take photos and record notes whenever he/she wants. Later, if the user wants to change this set up, he/she is able to do it in settings.</p>

<p>The user wears a PinPoint camera, checks how the camera is attached and where it’s pointed to (fig. 3.14) and goes hiking. When the user sees bears, he just says command and camera takes photos and notes. Later, the user opens the app, and sees all pictures taken during the hike (fig. 3.15). When the user selects a photo with the voice sign, he sees both photo and transcribed notes (fig. 3.16).</p>

<p>After removing manual deletion as a focus, we decided to switch our second task to searching for photos. After taking a photo and recording a memo to attach to that photo (fig. 3.17), users can navigate to our search menu (fig. 3.18). Searching for photos will use AI-powered photo recognition and descriptions (the transcribed memos) as searchable fields. Our search can also accommodate power users with an easy advanced search using keywords, two of which are illustrated in figures 3.19 and 3.20.</p>

<p>The user wears a PinPoint camera, checks how the camera is attached and where it’s pointed to (fig. 4.10) and goes about their adventures. When users see something notable, they activate their camera using their preset voice commands. Later, they open the app and see all the pictures taken during their adventures (fig. 4.11). When the users select a photo with the voice sign, they see both photo and transcribed notes (fig. 4.12). Users can record an audio without taking a picture, if so, the audio note will be depicted as an audio symbol in the gallery (fig. 4.13). Users can also take photos without recording audio notes, in this case, the audio can be recorded anytime later (fig. 4.14).</p>

<h4 id="changes-to-design">Changes to Design</h4>
<p>More visual elements: In our initial setup process, we added a lot more visual elements to help users understand the current status of the app, be clearer about the actions they are supposed to take, and keep their attention on the app. For example, instead of words we used different colors and icons to represent the status of camera connection. We also used a microphone icon to represent the action of recording a voice command. We added illustrations to make the setup process more interesting and easy to understand for users.</p>
<p>Streamlined process: We thought that our initial setup process was actually a bit long and tedious for the users, so we tried to cut down some redundant pages in order to streamline the setup process. For example, in our paper prototype, we have three pages for users to finish setting up a voice command, with one page for the instructions, one page for recording command and one page for confirmation or the option to retake. In our digital design, we combined three pages into one, so that users can view the instructions, click on the microphone icon to record the voice memo, view the result directly on the page and have an option to confirm or retake.</p>

<h3 id="problem-solution-overview">Problem &amp; Solution Overview</h3>
<p>Current solutions exist to reduce or prevent food waste, but they address different stages of the farm-to-table process, like discounting ”ugly” produce to prevent them from being thrown out, or smart fridges that tend to cost thousands of dollars. Our design research revealed that users were generally aware of wasting food and the costs that came with throwing out food -- the greater challenge for households was keeping track of what foods they had and what foods they needed.</p>
<p>That is, people tended to over-purchase items they forgot they still had, and then end up with forgotten food sitting in their fridge or pantries. Our mobile app design seeks to help individuals keep inventory of their current groceries by easily logging their grocery purchases, and knowing how and when to dispose of food items that have gone bad, as well as being reminded of their older food items and to use them before they went bad. Beginning from paper sketches and ending with our digital prototype, we iterated our design focusing on these two key tasks to provide a simple, familiar design that participants could easily integrate into their usual grocery routines.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>Based on our feedback from our original user research we decided the main features we wanted to add to our first prototype were the ability to scan groceries, keep track of the inventory, and have a way of knowing when food is going bad and how to dispose of it. We also wanted to add a tracking feature so people could see how much food waste they produce, and how much money they waste/save based on how attentive they are to their food waste habits.</p>

<h4 id="task-1-keeping-track-of-current-groceries-at-home">Task 1: Keeping track of current groceries at home</h4>
<p>From the main menu, users can tap “Scan Groceries” to take a photo of their receipt. After taking a photo, they are shown a preview of the items that were just added. At the top, if they tap “Tap for All Items”, they are then taken to the “My Items” page, which is a list of all of their own items. Otherwise, they can tap the hamburger button in the top left corner to return to the main menu. In addition to this list of grocery items, users can tap on “Track Food Waste” from the main menu and see both their food and money wasted over time.</p>

<h4 id="task-2-clearing-out-foods-that-have-gone-bad">Task 2: Clearing out foods that have gone bad</h4>
<p>In order to see items that have gone bad, or remove an expired item, the user will need to navigate to the main menu, and follow “My Items”. Once on the items page, they can select Categories from the button selections at the top of the screen, and two new buttons show up at the top labeled “Use it Soon” and “Expired”. By selecting Use it Soon they can see what items are expiring soon, and then follow each individual item for more info on how to use it. If they wanted to click on “Expired” this will show them all the items that have already gone bad based on their expiration date. After selecting a specific expired item, they can then see the disposal options for the item, and easily tap “Clear” to remove it from their items.</p>

<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<p>Using both heuristic evaluations and usability tests, we received feedback from three UW students, asking them to pretend to use our app to check their groceries. In our usability tests, they complete several actions required by the two tasks we focused on. These actions included scanning new groceries, which was part of Task 1 (Keeping track of current groceries at home); throwing out expired groceries, which was part of Task 2 (Clearing out foods that have gone bad); and checking what groceries they currently had, which was part of both tasks.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-refining-our-prototype">Testing Results/Refining Our Prototype</h3>
<h4 id="usability-test-1">Usability Test 1</h4>
<p>After our first usability test, we added the title “My Items” to our main items page for more clarity. In the same screen, we also merged the various sort and filter options (e.g. “Use it Soon”, “Expired”, “Categories”) into just two buttons, “Sort” and “Filter”. These buttons were both enlarged, along with a new “Show Days” button that could hide and show the number of days remaining in the shelf life of each food item; this new button helped reduce visual clutter for the user.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>In our “Items Scanned” page, we provided more control to users by adding buttons to retake the photo of their receipt, as well as the ability to manually edit food items before adding them to the user’s list.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-2">Usability Test 2</h4>
<p>In our second usability test, we changed the hamburger menu into a bottom navigation bar to make navigation to the most important resources more accessible. Minor features, such as account settings and help, were unnecessary for this navigation bar as they did not assist in achieving our two tasks.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>Before our “Items Scanned” page, we also added a “Confirm Photo” page to provide users more control during each step in the process of adding new items. This also allowed us to remove the “Retake Photo” button that was on the “Items Scanned” page in our earlier prototype, and so the “Items Scanned” page now only had just a “Cancel” button and a “Confirm” button.</p>

</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-3">Usability Test 3</h4>
<p>During our third usability test, we determined that users might want to add items manually without scanning a receipt. Therefore, we changed the “Camera” button in our navigation bar into an “Add” button. When users tapped it, they were then prompted to choose one of two floating buttons to either scan a receipt or manually add items.</p>

</p>
<p>We also added a tutorial to explain all the features and shortcuts to users; this tutorial would only appear after an initial log-in. Some features, such as swiping on individual items to either share or delete them, weren’t intuitive for users, and so the tutorial helps users to efficiently navigate the app.</p>

<p>Because of its significant usage, users add items by tapping the button on the navigation bar, located in the middle. This prompts them to choose whether they want to take a photo of their receipt, or manually add items. Tapping on the camera prompts the user to take a photo, and after taking a photo, they are taken to a confirmation page. The user can look at their photo and either choose to retake it or continue with the photo. The system will read each item on the receipt and display them on the “Item Scanned” page. There, the user can edit the list by tapping the pencil button at the top. At the end, the user must confirm or cancel this list, and confirming will add the scanned items to the “My Items” page, which appears after confirmation.</p>

<p>The expected shelf life for items are shown by the color indicators by each item. The user can also tap “Show Days” to see how many days are left for each item. To see only expired items, users can filter their items to “Show expired” from the “Filter” drop-down menu. Users can swipe left to remove expired items, or tap into the item itself to read about disposal, and then remove it from this same page. For items that are expiring soon, can share it with friends by swiping right, or by again tapping into the item’s info and tapping the “Share” button.</p>

<h3 id="digital-mockup">Digital Mockup</h3>
<p>Between our final paper prototype and our digital mockup, we focused on creating visual elements that were easily recognizable from existing mobile apps (such as text fonts, button shadows, and a pencil or gear icon for editing items or going to settings, respectively). We also simplified the design by reducing the navigation bar to three pages -- the items list, adding new items, and the user’s profile, providing a more navigable visual interface that would not immediately overwhelm users by all the options available.</p>
<h4 id="task-1-keeping-track-of-current-groceries-at-home-3">Task 1: Keeping track of current groceries at home</h4>
<p>Users begin by tapping the center navigation button, taking them to the camera so that they can take a photo of their receipt; if users would rather add an item manually, there is also the alternative option on this same screen if they tap “ADD ITEMS MANUALLY”. After taking a photo, they can confirm the photo looks good, or go back to retake it if it is out of focus. Before finalizing items added to their list, they can check that the items were scanned correctly and make adjustments as needed. Upon confirming the items, they are then taken back to their items page.</p>

The user can then look at each individual item to learn more about the item and check for signs of expiration, as well as how to dispose of the containers. With a single tap of the “CLEAR ALL ITEMS” button at the bottom of the items list, users can then easily clear out all these expired items, and remove them from their list.</p>

<p>Pocket Planner transforms bullet journaling into a fully interactive digital and physical experience with a smart journal and an app, integrating automated tracking, data visualization, and various methods for data entry to personalize bullet journaling and make it more <strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>empowering</strong>, and <strong>accessible</strong> to all. Our smart journal design focuses on maintaining the tactile experience of writing down your tasks, journal entries, and plans, while our mobile app focuses on improving accessibility and efficiency. Though our initial project pitch was focused on making the artistic portion of bullet journaling less intimidating, throughout the quarter, we have found that making bullet journaling more accessible and efficient is just as important to both reducing the barrier to entry and increasing the rate of retention.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>Our initial paper prototype included apps for four different devices: smart watches, smart phones, desktops / laptops, and smart journals. All apps supported checking calendars, jotting down to-do tasks, writing diaries, and marking habit trackers. These functionalities are all synced across the different platforms to make journaling more efficient and flexible.</p>

<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<h4 id="heuristic-evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
<p>The evaluation was conducted in class by a student taking CSE 440. We first gave a brief introduction of our product to the participant and then the participant went through Nielsen’s 10 heuristics for all four platforms. The first issue that we uncovered was a lack of consistency among all four platforms in terms of functionality and design layout. The second was a lack of user control and freedom. This concern came from confusion about how to navigate between dates and weeks in the monthly and weekly spread and how to edit and delete events in the monthly spreads across the devices.</p>
<h4 id="usability-tests">Usability Tests</h4>
<p>We followed the protocol presented below for our usability tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction / Warm-Up:</strong> We introduced ourselves, explained the goals of a usability test, and discussed how it would work.</li>
<li><strong>Transition:</strong> We explained the purpose of our project’s design and what our participant’s role was.</li>
<li><strong>Test:</strong> We asked the participant to complete two tasks:
<ul>
<li>Access their organization tools everywhere across multiple devices</li>
<li>Take time to be mindful and to write down tasks and thoughts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wrap-Up:</strong> We asked the participant for feedback, both positive and constructive, regarding the usability of the design, consistency across different platforms, and the clarity of the overall system.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="participant-1">Participant 1</h5>
<p>For our first usability test, our participant was Jaden (pseudonym), a senior in Computer Science who is also taking CSE 440 this quarter. We chose to ask Jaden as his project is similar to ours (Remi-nice) and focuses on increasing mindfulness without adding too many additional tasks; however, there are a couple of key differences. We wanted to understand what insights he could bring to our project since he has also thought about similar functionalities. We conducted the usability test in the CSE Atrium at 9:30 PM. Our test protocol consisted of Chia-Lin prompting Jaden to perform each task on each platform. Chia-Lin was the facilitator and Lucy and Natasya were the observers and computers. A revision for our process is to make sure that our usability testers use all four platforms interchangeably for finishing a task, so that they can test how someone would react to the idea that some limitations on some devices (such as the smart watch) have different interactions on other devices.</p>
<h5 id="participant-2">Participant 2</h5>
<p>After making revisions to our paper prototype based on the first usability test, we conducted our second usability test during quiz session with Alice (pseudonym), a senior in Computer Science who is also taking CSE 440 this quarter. We chose to ask Alice because she is in our target audience, she has also learned about HCI through the class, and she has a bit of experience with bullet journaling. We conducted the usability test in Room 295 of Mary Gates Hall at 1:30 PM as part of our section activities. Chia-Lin was the facilitator and computer and Natasya was the facilitator and observer. One key difference between this and the previous usability test is that we allowed the participant to get familiar with the prototype in the beginning and laid out all four platforms instead of presenting them one at a time. This change helped the participant see the product as a whole instead of thinking of it as four different designs. Another revision we made for our process was to give the participant a more holistic scenario in which they would perform the tasks, instead of asking them to complete the tasks as they would cater to each individual product. This helped us learn how they would navigate through all four devices seamlessly.</p>
<h5 id="participant-3">Participant 3</h5>
<p>For our third usability test, our participant was Harry (pseudonym), a 28-year-old software engineer at Google. We chose to ask Harry as he fits as our target audience; he is active and has a busy schedule throughout the week. We also wanted to understand what insights and new perspectives that people other than students could bring to our project. We conducted the usability test at a friend’s house in Shoreline at 9 PM. We chose this location because it was more convenient for him. Our test protocol consisted of Natasya prompting Harry to perform each task on each platform. She was also the observer and computer. The key difference between this and previous usability tests was that we gave the participant broader tasks and more concrete scenarios for each task. This change helped the participant picture the situation and act more naturally, like they would in a real-life situation. Especially as the participant was not a student in CSE 440, this usability test also helped to expose a couple of other confusing portions of our design.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement">Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</h3>
<h4 id="inconsistency-across-all-platforms-and-devices">Inconsistency across all platforms and devices</h4>
<p>One major issue that we faced was ensuring consistency across all platforms. Each group member created the paper prototype for each different platform. We ended up with fairly different versions of the app both in the interface design and functionality. Though each platform has its own methods of specialized interaction, the interface design and basic functionalities should still be consistent because agreeing upon a consistent user interface design and set of functionalities helps people keep a clear mental model.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/usability_inconsistency.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><em>Revisions included making all the icons consistent across devices and removing the mood tracking function from some devices.</em></p>
<h4 id="lack-of-user-control-and-freedom-to-add-and-remove-things-and-jump-between-dates">Lack of user control and freedom to add and remove things and jump between dates</h4>
<p>Another issue that came up was the incapability to add and remove things from the apps. This problem occurred across all platforms. In the smart journal, we initially did not account for erasing writing, and we did not incorporate the idea of removing habit trackers across all of the platforms. Our usability tests revealed that people can make mistakes, and designs require ways to either prevent errors or warn people that their actions are invalid. We have worked on supporting functionalities to add, edit, and remove events or tasks on all of our platforms.</p>
<p>Additionally, the only way to view different entries or habit trackers was to swipe left and right or pressing the left and right arrows to manually and incrementally go through time. There was no fast way to see entries or spreads from previous months or years. We have added a date jumping functionality, which follows existing calendar design patterns to make it easier for people to access different dates across days, weeks, months, or years.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/usability_user_control.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><em>Revisions included adding an edit and delete functionality and a date jumper functionality.</em></p>
<h4 id="lack-of-clarity-with-graph-visualizations">Lack of clarity with graph visualizations</h4>
<p>Our last primary revision was for the graph visualizations of the habit trackers. Our design previously had no real values and units and lacked meaning and significance. Based on feedback from our usability testing, we have added some units and numerical data to give a more detailed and clear tracking record, and we also clarified what the goal line represented.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/usability_clarity.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

<p>Donna is a 22-year-old computer science student at the University of Washington. In the morning, before she begins her day, she pulls out her smart journal to write down important tasks and events that she wants to keep in mind, using the journal as a way to express herself creatively and artistically.</p>
<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <div style="max-width: 350px; vertical-align: top; display: inline-block;" class="m-3">
    <p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/dm_sc3_monthly_spread.png" width="100%" class="border rounded"></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">She flips to the monthly spread to see her schedule. She suddenly remembers that she has agreed to attend a GRE prep session with Sam on Saturday, February 22, 2020 from 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 350px; vertical-align: top; display: inline-block;" class="m-3">
    <p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/dm_sc3_monthly_spread_updated.png" width="100%" class="border rounded"></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">She uses her stylus to write the information down.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 350px; vertical-align: top; display: inline-block;" class="m-3">
    <p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/dm_sc3_weekly_spread.png" width="100%" class="border rounded"></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">She also wants to write down her tasks for Friday, February 21, 2020. She opens the journal to the weekly spread and sees that her events on Saturday reflect what she has just written down in the monthly spread.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 350px; vertical-align: top; display: inline-block;" class="m-3">
    <p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/dm_sc3_weekly_spread_updated.png" width="100%" class="border rounded"></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">She writes down her tasks for Friday, February 21, 2020 using the stylus.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 350px; vertical-align: top; display: inline-block;" class="m-3">
    <p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/dm_sc3_diary_empty.png" width="100%" class="border rounded"></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">So that she will not forget memories from last weekend, she decides to write a journal entry. She begins writing it down using the stylus.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 350px; vertical-align: top; display: inline-block;" class="m-3">
    <p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/dm_sc3_diary_halfway.png" width="100%" class="border rounded"></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">However, halfway through, she feels a bit rushed and does not know if she can finish writing it down in time. Instead, she records her journal entry so that she can finish it before going to class. She clicks on the microphone button to start recording her diary.</p>
  </div>
  <div style="max-width: 350px; vertical-align: top; display: inline-block;" class="m-3">
    <p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/dm_sc3_diary_finished.png" width="100%" class="border rounded"></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">She finishes her recording, and now she can view her entire diary entry. With just fifteen minutes of reflection, Donna feels less anxious and she is ready to head off to class.</p>

<h4 id="changes-between-the-paper-prototypes-and-the-digital-mockups">Changes Between the Paper Prototypes and the Digital Mockups</h4>
<p>The biggest change we made in our digital mockup was to abandon the smart watch and desktop app designs. We encountered several issues with internal consistency across the different platforms. Initially, we designed the apps across multiple platforms to improve the accessibility and convenience of bullet journaling. However, these inconsistencies caused our participants to be confused when they could use some functionalities on the mobile app but not on the smart watch, or vice versa. At first, we revised our designs on all of the platforms to make them consistent, but we later found out that cutting out unnecessary apps was a more effective and time-efficient way to reduce a participant’s confusion. As a result, we re-analyzed the necessity of each app and made two main decisions: to transform the easy accessibility of the smart watch app into a widget of the mobile app, and to remove the desktop design as its primary functionality of providing a larger display for clearer graphs was possible through the smart journal.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, the mobile app in the digital mockup has an extra widget for improved accessibility. The widget provides a quick view of today’s events and tasks, and allows someone to quickly check and input information into their to-do lists, diary entries, or habit trackers. This eliminates the need to open and load the mobile app just to check events or habit trackers, making the interaction less inconvenient. As for the smart journal, it still allows people to write things down and have a tactile experience with bullet journaling, while also providing a larger viewing area. The two platforms that we created for our digital mockups were the mobile app, which focuses on convenience, efficiency, and accessibility, and the smart journal, which provides people with the tactile experience that they know and love.</p>

# **Poolbuddy: carpooling within a community**
-->
<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
<p>Carpooling significantly reduces driving costs and environmental impact. It is a great opportunity to find people with similar interests in your city. However, scheduling rides is often too difficult to maintain and many do not know where to begin looking for carpoolers.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>We aim to make carpooling more convenient. Our proposed solution supports routine carpooling schedules, accommodates the preferences of both the drivers and the riders, and ensures clear communication and safety throughout the entire carpooling experience.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1overview.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task2overview.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Our initial paper prototype focused on two key tasks. The first involves creating a new account on the PoolBuddy platform and setting up a ride with a rider that the user finds through searching on PoolBuddy. Our second task involves a driver actually starting a scheduled ride and notifying the passengers with the expected ETA. We chose these two tasks as we felt that these were the ones that were the most common and practical. While we spent time discussing and designing various subsystems, such as the personal profile and friend system, ensuring that our application could perform the tasks most practically beneficial to users was a top priority.</p>
<h4 id="task-1-finding-carpoolers-with-the-same-route">Task 1: Finding Carpoolers with the Same Route</h4>
<p>Our first task begins with a fairly simple onboarding process. Our main focus here was allow users to enter personal preferences, which would later be used to match riders.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_onboarding.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Once the user is brought to the Upcoming Rides screen, they can start a new ride by clicking the ‘+’ icon in the upper right corner. After entering information regarding the ride, they can create the ride and see information such as its current passengers and route. The driver is also able to start the ride from this screen.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_task1-3.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">
</p>
<p>To add a new carpooler, the user clicks the ‘+’ icon underneath the “People” section. This will bring them to the Friends page, where they can add people that they are already friends with. If they want to find new carpoolers they click the ‘+’ icon in the top right corner, which will show them a profile of a rider that matches with their route and preferences. The profile includes a rating, preferences, as well as an approximation of the added time to the trip and the potential financial compensation for choosing the rider. The user can then choose to accept the rider or reject and search for a new one using the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Accepting the rider will bring the user back to the ride page, and a pending invitation will be sent to that rider, as shown in the “People” section.</p>

<h4 id="task-2-start-a-carpool-ride-and-communicate-with-passengers">Task 2: Start a Carpool Ride and Communicate with Passengers</h4>
<p>Our second task starts with the user getting a notification that a ride they have set up is about to begin. Tapping the notification brings them to the Upcoming Rides screen, which has the ride they’ve created in the first task. Selecting the card brings them to the same ride screen, and from here they can start the ride.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>Starting the ride brings them to a navigation screen, similar to Google Maps. To communicate with the passengers, the driver can press the chat icon in the bottom right corner to bring up a chat window with the other members of the ride.</p>

<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<h4 id="heuristic-evaluation-process-and-participant">Heuristic Evaluation Process and Participant</h4>
<p>A student and TA from within this class assisted us with our evaluation. We evaluated our initial paper prototype by having the student walk through our tasks and evaluate them according to Nielsen’s heuristics.</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-protocol">Usability Test Protocol</h4>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>We started the test by giving the participants the following introduction of our project and the test:</p>
<p>“We are students in CSE working on designing an app to facilitate carpooling for the general public. Our goals are to provide a platform to organize carpools and help users build a network of reliable people to carpool with. Today we will be testing the effectiveness of our app in achieving these goals. We are not testing your ability to complete the tasks we set for you in any way, rather, we will be using our observations of your test in conjunction with the feedback you provide us to elicit areas of improvement in our design.”</p>
<p><strong>Tasks 1: Onboarding + Finding a Carpool with a new Person as a driver</strong></p>
<p>Script: “Imagine that you have relocated to a new city for a new job. You have decided to use our carpool app to share your new company car for carpooling as a way to save on expenses and make new friends. You would like to create an account and then use the app to set up a carpool. Since you have no friends in the area you would like to find a person to carpool with using the app.”</p>
<p><strong>Task 2: Starting the carpool and communicating the ETA to the rider</strong></p>
<p>Script: ”Now imagine that the time has come for you to start your carpool ride. As you are the driver, your phone alerts you that it is time to get going. Start your ride on the app and get driving. Make sure to message your partner your ETA halfway through your ride.”</p>
<p><strong>Usability Testing Roles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Perry, the computer, was in charge of changing the screens based on their interactions.</li>
<li>Mengjiao, the facilitator, gave the participant the background of the project and facilitated her as she completed the tasks.</li>
<li>Rachel, the note taker, documented any notable incidents and participant comments.</li>
<li>Nadir, the video recorder, took a video of them going through the tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Usability Testing Participants</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>University student with prior carpool experience who was interested in sharing her car</li>
<li>A student from within this class who was interested in carpooling and knowledgeable about good design practices</li>
<li>Working professional who was interested in carpooling as a rider to reduce her commute.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process Refinement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After our first test, we added a more descriptive scenario to both our scripts to provide more context for the participant doing our tasks.</li>
<li>After our second test, we decided to breakdown our script for task 1 by first asking them to complete the onboarding and then giving them rest of the scenario for the task. This was done to reduce the amount of information the participant had to retain prior to onboarding</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="design-critique">Design Critique</h4>
<p>Four students and TA from within this class assisted us with our design critique. We demonstrated our digital mockup by walking them through our tasks.</p>

<h4 id="heuristic-evaluations">Heuristic Evaluations</h4>
<p><em>Match between System and Real World</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The functionalities of the features in login screen were not clear. We made the registration and login options more distinct by moving the signing up process further down the page.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Error Prevention</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Unclear idea about what needs to be inputted when signing up. Added placeholder text that shows an acceptable input and restricted input types to only numbers for phone numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

<p><em>Visibility of System Status</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page for scanning driver licenses was unclear. It does not indicate what is supposed to be scanned. Added description text on the page telling people what they are supposed to scan. A follow-up screen can check what they scanned as well.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p><em>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Process of adding carpoolers felt unnecessarily long. Added a simpler view on potential carpoolers in card view, where tapping on the card will bring the user to a larger, more-detailed view of each carpooler’s information and the ability to request this carpooler to ride on this screen.</li>

</p>
<p><em>User Control and Freedom</em></p>
<ul>
<li>There was no feature that prevented users from tapping on a potential carpooler and requesting them to their ride on accident. Added confirmation dialog when requesting a carpooler to ride.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="usability-test-results">Usability Test Results</h4>
<p><em>Simplified Ride Scheduling and Clarified User Expectations</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This allows the app to better accommodate the user’s needs, where drivers have greater control about the passengers and routes while riders can choose rides that best suit their schedules. App first asks whether the user wants to be the driver or rider as only drivers can create carpool rides while riders can only request rides and join existing rides.</li>
</ul>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  <img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/before_create1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded">

</p>
<p><em>Clarifying Ride Statuses</em></p>
<ul>
<li>recurring theme in our usability tests was that people would often try to start the ride prematurely since there were no indicators that the ride needed to be confirmed first. Prevented drivers from starting carpool rides when not all the passengers have confirmed their invitations to the ride by graying out the “Start Ride” option.</li>
</ul>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p><em>Driver Safety and Simpler Communication</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Distracted drivers put all carpoolers in the car at risk of accidents. Another related issue is that carpoolers are not providing necessary information to maintain clear communication between all carpoolers in the ride. Created automated messaging specifying information about their estimated time of arrival for drivers to use especially driving.</li>

<h4 id="design-critique-results">Design Critique Results</h4>
<p><em>Clearer Indications during Onboarding</em></p>

<li>The onboarding process was confusing and had ambiguous questions. Added text descriptions to clarify whether the questions should be answered based on the drivers’ or the riders’ perspective</li>
</ul>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p><em>Dual Coding for Indication</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We used to use color green to tell user which page they are currently on, which is not user-friendly who have color deficiency. Therefore, We added a shade of green to dual code the information</li>

<h4 id="task-1-finding-carpoolers-with-the-same-route-2">Task 1: Finding Carpoolers with the Same Route</h4>
<p>Our onboarding process remained relatively unchanged in terms of the overall structure, and the majority of the improvements were on improving clarity.</p>

<p>In the final design, the user can now choose whether to create a ride as a rider or as a driver. After providing the information about the ride, the user is brought to the ride page where they can see information about the ride such as its current passengers and route. They can also chat with the riders, and edit ride information.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>Adding a new carpooler will then bring the user to a screen showing the summary cards of various carpoolers. Selecting one of these cards will bring up the full profile. The user can then decide to accept, reject, or chat with the carpooler. If the rider accepts, they accept the confirmation dialog and are brought back to the ride screen. Here the screen clearly shows the pending request and indicates that the ride is not able to be started while the request is pending.</p>

The task begins with the same notification screen, which will bring the user to the Upcoming Rides screen when selected. Selecting the card for the ride will bring the user to the ride screen, where they can start the ride.</p>

<ul>
<li>The biggest change made when implementing the digital mockup is differentiating between the driver and passenger interactions in the app. The usability test consistently showed there were minor confusions between what these two roles. Therefore, we decided to create restrictions to better distinguish these roles.</li>
<li>When creating a ride, the wording of the input labels were not clear to the participants in the usability testing study. We decided to change the wording of each label and added the estimated duration of the ride to give more information about the ride to the driver and passengers in the ride.</li>
<li>In the onboarding process, we added more questions into the preferences section to create a more realistic portrayal.</li>
<li>To create more flexibility and adhere to the real world match heuristics, we added the option to edit rides information.</li>
<li>In order to follow the visibility of system status heuristics, we also added appropriate feedback from the app whenever a button is clicked or whenever there is information that we want the user to understand. For example, when adding carpoolers to the ride, those added passengers will need to confirm this new change first and cancelling the ride will also require all passengers to confirm this before this action can be com</li>

<h3 id="id-1-problem-and-solution-overview">1. Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>From our design research, we felt that our participants wanted to be able to easily access the speech analysis and improvements section, as well as track their progress throughout their experience. The problem of new people in their fields struggling with learning and mastering sophisticated jargon remained the focus as we created our initial design. As mentioned earlier, we chose to use a watch and smartphone app pair for our solution, as we felt like it best met the tasks obtained from our design research. Initially, we tried to focus our solution on easy access to speech analysis and improvements, since we felt like that is what our design research pointed us to. This is reflected in the paper prototype below and the tasks we supported with the prototype.</p>
<h3 id="id-2-initial-paper-prototype">2. Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>The initial paper prototype overview can be seen below:</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/initial_prototype_overview.png" alt="initial prototype overview" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>initial prototype overview</b></p>
<p>There are two components of ProCabulary's initial design. There is a phone application that is paired with a smart watch.</p>
<p>The first task that was outlined in the paper prototype was to learn the technical knowledge bank from conversations. This includes the wearable pairing process and wearable recording steps, which can be seen here:</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>The other aspects of this task have to do with learning the knowledge, which can be done by looking at the recordings summary page, which has a record of conversations and a detailed description of each recording with playback functionality:</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>The keywords page has a list of words taken from the recordings that are arranged by topic and sorted by frequency, so each person can easily see the words they want to learn:</p>

</p>
<p>The second task that was outlined in the paper prototype was to raise the level of professionalism in one’s own speech. This can be accomplished via the improvements page, as it shows words and phrases you are currently doing well in, keywords you need to improve on, and similar words that relate to the topic. Clicking on one of the bars brings up the detailed view of the given word:</p>

<h3 id="id-3-testing-process">3. Testing Process</h3>
<p>Our testing process includes 3 <strong>heuristic evaluations</strong> with another group from class as well as 2 students outside CSE department; 2 <strong>design critiques</strong> with TAs and other 2 groups during sections, and 3 <strong>usability tests</strong> of our paper prototypes with our target participants who have particular requirements to master their sophisticated and specialized jargons and information in their professional realms.</p>
<h4 id="heuristic-evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation 1: Evaluated by Sarah, conducted by Francis and Zhennan</li>
<li>Evaluation 2: Evaluated by Jane, conducted by Francis, Karron and Zhennan</li>
<li>Evaluation 3: Evaluated by Group x from CSE 440, conducted by Francis, Arjun and Zhennan</li>
</ul>
<p>In our initial heuristic evaluation, we began with laying out all of our paper prototypes on the table and giving our participants an exploratory walkthrough of our prototypes so that they can be familiarized with our system. Subsequently, we asked our participants to attempt to finish 2 of our primary tasks. Then we went over the heuristic evaluation one by one and discussed any further questions. However, with our first participant, we found out that our participant had a strong inclination to follow the procedures we just showed to finish the task instead of understanding what she was asked to do and reacted based on what was presented on the paper prototype. Therefore, in the following heuristic evaluations, we instead introduced our study, our system as well as tasks to be carried out to our participants patiently and gave a brief walkthrough of our system with an unrelated task before testing our prototypes. Afterward, the team went through each of the problems we spotted during heuristic evaluation and discussed potential reasons and corresponding solutions.</p>
<h4 id="design-critiques">Design Critiques</h4>
<p>After the initial in-class evaluation and testing, we received feedback from our TAs, Jesse and Richard, regarding our goal setup process. “How do we evaluate goals and progress during the first few weeks of use; where do your sources of data come from in the first few weeks for evaluation” etc. Those questions were instructive and enlightening for us, as it pushed us to think thoroughly and profoundly in terms of the pivotal goal-setting process and its potential influence on users’ following actions. It was helpful because we were able to brainstorm solutions and receive feedback immediately.</p>
<h4 id="usability-testings">Usability Testings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test1: Biology major undergraduate student who works as a Lab Assistant in a Biology Lab.</li>
<li>Test2: A first-year master’s student from UW’s information school who is trying to pursue a career in technical consulting.</li>
<li>Test3: a UW HCDE undergraduate student during CSE 440 usability testing section.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of our 3 usability testings went smoothly well and we received a lot of insightful responses and meaningful suggestions. Our usability testing consisted of 3 important stages. The first stage was background questions for us to gain general ideas regarding our participants’ current circumstances (e.g. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), etc. In the meantime, we also offered our participants a brief overview of our study for them to build a basic understanding of our prototype. The initial stage created an opportunity for us to build rapport with our participants. The second stage was our main usability testing, which we divided into 2 parts based on 2 primary tasks we decided to support. The final stage was debriefings and asking and answering questions regarding our participants’ experience with the prototypes, confusions and thoughts. Initially, we had multiple team members acting as the notetakers. However, as we repeated the process, we found out that this created too much extra work to compile and organize and locate our testing documents later on. Therefore, we then let one team member be the notetaker for the rest of the usability testing to document changes more systematically. Similarly, as the testing progressed, each of us was getting familiarized with the roles we’ve selected and made the testing process more efficient.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>prototype refinements overview</b></p>
<h4 id="home-screen-revision">Home screen revision</h4>
<p>Although the participants appreciated the motivation design on the landing page, 2 of them mentioned that since the main goal of using this app is to collect information from conversations and to improve their speech, they would like to see more content related to the past conversations, rather than the progress chart and feeds. Based on their feedback, we decided to include interactive elements that are more irrelevant to their improvement on the home page. In the revisioned home screen, users can check out their most recent recordings and assessment of their recent progress.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/main_paper.png" alt="initial prototype overview" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>main page - paper prototype changes</b></p>
<h4 id="timeline-revision">Timeline revision</h4>
<p>In the initial paper prototype, we include timeline as a tool to help the participant track their improvement process. However, the initial timeline design is confusing, including only the status of “accomplished” and “not accomplished” tasks. Our participants were unclear about what a “task” is, and how can those milestones on the timeline give them a more tangible idea of their accomplishment. One of our participants suggested that it would be more helpful if statistical reports of each task were provided. We decided to tackle this issue by establishing a more solid measurement of the user’s progress toward their goal. After testing the revised version with P3, we found out that, from a beginner’s point of view, the tasks in the timeline might be less intimidating if the tasks can be broken down into several small tasks.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/timeline_paper.png" alt="initial prototype overview" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>timeline - paper prototype changes</b></p>
<h4 id="goals-setting-revision">Goals setting revision</h4>
<p>Based on the feedback of our participants, the goal-setting feature in the initial paper prototype is vague. It only allows them to choose between beginner, intermediate and advanced, and once the users set their goals, the system would generate a timeline accordingly. This leads to several issues. For example, if P2 wants to improve her speech, then it wouldn’t be as helpful if the system assigns her tasks of memorizing vocabulary. We decided that the goal-setting should be more granular so that some users can choose to focus mostly on vocabulary learning, while others can primarily focus on speech improvement. To further define the goals, we decided to extract information from the user by using a survey. Users can not only select the fields that they want to develop verbal expertise but also which task they want to perform. Another problem is that the users’ self-perceived competencies in their areas might be different from the reality, so we decided to introduce the concept of ‘trial week’ during setup, where a baseline of skill level is established during the first week of use.</p>

<h4 id="practice-mode-revision">Practice mode revision</h4>
<p>We didn’t have robust practice functionality in our initial design, and two participants in our usability tests expressed a desire to be able to do more of that, which highlighted it as an important issue for us to solve. We tackled the problems from both perspectives, adding quizzes in the keyword section and adding the mock conversation feature in the improvement section. Fixing this problem is important since it adds functionality people seek to use. The practice mode allows people to review the things they see as important to them and lets them try out their newfound knowledge in a safe space with the mock conversation tool.</p>

<h4 id="task-1-record-speech-and-review-compiled-words-phrases-and-summaries">Task 1: Record speech and review compiled words, phrases and summaries</h4>
<p>The participant who downloaded the app on their phone as well as on their smartwatch needs to go through a setup process to pair the watch and the phone for secure audio data transfer. Then the participant needs to register his/her voice to let the system recognize the master during recording. After registering the voice to the system, the client will be prompted to set the goals he/she wants to reach in the future. After watching a short tutorial, the system and the wearable are ready to work. When we walk through a scenario in which the client has already finished recording on his/her watch, the client is able to tap the the watch again and open the app on the phone to check the detailed information parsed and extracted by the system.</p>
<h4 id="task-2-improve-vocabulary-and-speech-through-practice-mode">Task 2: Improve vocabulary and speech through practice mode</h4>
<p>When the participant opens the app for the first time, he/she needs to set up his/her profile, providing information about which field he/she wants to improve their proficiency in, his/her current fluency in that field, and what goal he/she wishes to achieve. To do so, the participant should click the Status and Goal. After specifying his/her fields, the participant can see the survey that contains two sections. The participant can choose either of the sections or both of them according to his/her needs. The survey serves as an initial measurement of the participant's verbal competencies based on his/her perception. However, because participants' perceptions of their competencies might vary from reality, the system will assess their skill level and establish it as the baseline of their improvement journey. The participant can track his/her progress by clicking the timeline icon on the lower menu. They can also take the quiz and mock conversations to strengthen memorization and practice their speech.</p>
<h3 id="id-6-digital-mockup">6. Digital Mockup</h3>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/digital_overview.png" alt="initial prototype overview" width="100%" style="max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>digital mockup overview</b></p>
<p>We made 3 significant changes in the process of transitioning from paper prototype to digital mockup. First and foremost, we consolidated practice modes in our digital mockup to include more obvious practice buttons, immersive conversations and incorporate results into the progress page, so that it is convenient for users to review and track their progress over time. The improvement page in our paper prototypes received a design overhaul in our digital mockup compared to our paper prototypes to be more informative as well as enlightening. Originally, we provided only binary analyzed results of highlighted keywords as well as corresponding audio clips. But in our digital mockup, we enriched the entire page by adding more relevant details, such as the matching keywords of a specific context and its explanations and usages, to better help our users memorize important information through contextualization. In the digital mockup, we include a universal search button in summary, keyword and improvement pages, instead of the hidden search bar, to make it more obvious, easy-to-reach and give them direct shortcuts to filter out and pinpoint the materials they specifically want.</p>
<h4 id="tasks-breakdown">Tasks Breakdown</h4>
<p>Our two primary tasks are: <strong>1) Record speech and review compiled words, phrases and summaries</strong> and <strong>2) Raise the level of professionalism in one's own speech through practices</strong>. Descriptions of each of these tasks are provided below, alongside the important digital mockup components.</p>
<h5 id="task-1-record-speech-and-review-compiled-words-phrases-and-summaries-2">Task 1: Record speech and review compiled words, phrases and summaries</h5>
<p>Users who downloaded the app on their phone as well as on their smartwatch need to go through several initial setup processes to activate the system. In particular, they need to pair their watch with their mobile devices for secure audio data transmission as well as setting up their short-term and long-term goal by answering a series of questions. The setup process is crucial, as it acts as the basis for the system to recognize its user, adjust itself based on user’s particular circumstances, and provide more accurate subsequent analysis and suggestions. Moreover, our design also allows users to take advantage of summaries and keywords functionalities inside the App to review important materials, words, phrases after professional conversations. For example, users can take a look at each summary block to remind himself/herself of the topic and key content of a certain conversation. Even, they can utilize the key audio clips attached to each summary for more context and information. In addition to the summary page, the keywords page can assist users to memorize the most useful and important words, phrases from professional conversations. If they still feel confused about particular words, they can open key audio clips and definitions to reactivate their memory. The primary aim of the design is to help users build concrete foundations in their professional industries. A walkthrough is shown below:</p>
<p><strong>Use of Watch.</strong>
Users are able to fully control their data on their watches. For instance, if they find one conversation to be particularly essential, they can highlight them using flags and their priority in the system will rise. Similarly, if they find a conversation meaningless or pointless, they can directly delete the recording in the middle of the recording.</p>

<h5 id="task-2-raise-the-level-of-professionalism-in-one-s-own-speech-through-practices">Task 2: Raise the level of professionalism in one's own speech through practices</h5>
<p>Our second task focuses on long-term improvements of professionalism in one’s own speeches and is greatly supported by our practice mode as well as improvement feature. The practice mode in the keyword list enables users to strengthen their memory about those keywords by using quizzes. Additionally, the improvement features can help users contextualize their understanding towards certain keywords using contexts in the conversations; practice mode in the improvement page allows users to participate in an immersive, professional conversation with a virtual assistant on the topics they’ve selected. All the results will be combined and display directly on the progress page and main page so that users can easily keep track of their progress. The primary objective of the design is to inform users of their inadequacy in certain areas and help them improve accordingly. A walkthrough is shown below:</p>
<p><strong>Practice Mode in Keyword.</strong>
Sometimes, accurately memorizing keywords and jargon and their definitions are key to academic success. Under this circumstance, users can tap the “Quiz” button at the bottom of the keyword page and opt to have quizzes to strengthen their memorization. So that once a keyword pops up from conversations, users can immediately recognize it and extend the conversations to be more in-depth and intriguing.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>quiz</b></p>
  </div>
</div>
<p><strong>Practice Mode in conversations.</strong>
It’s common for users who have difficulties speaking the professional language to be intimidated by engaging in professional conversations with others. In this case, they can practice by themselves using the practice mode in conversation. By clicking the “start mockup” button at the bottom of the improvement page and choosing which topics to cover, users can start a conversation with the AI chatbot. When the mockup conversation is finished, the analysis report of their mockup conversation can be found in the improvement page for the users to check out their performance in the practice.</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview">Problem and Solution Overview</h3>
<p>Our design aims to help people easily record their daily lives to actively facilitate effective and enjoyable reminiscing. To explore this, we conducted a survey and series of interviews to understand how people go through tasks involving journaling and  reminiscing. Some themes we found were that people use a variety of mediums to journal and that each individual has unique patterns of how they go about cataloging their memories. Further, many individuals saw journaling as a daunting task but wanted other ways to document memories they could look back on.</p>
<p>We identified six tasks related to recording memories so they be retained for the purpose of reminiscing: <strong>(1)</strong> going back through old media to reminisce, <strong>(2)</strong> evaluating memories and actively highlighting “more valuable” ones, <strong>(3)</strong> recording in a journal as a way to process thoughts and emotions, <strong>(4)</strong> drawing insights and making goals pertaining to social experiences from recordings, <strong>(5)</strong> regular intervals of recording everyday life in a journal, and <strong>(6)</strong> sharing past memories and accompanying thoughts with friends. After exploring various ideas involving physical journals, integrating social platforms into a daily entries, and bridging the digital and physical realms of journaling, we decided to focus on two primary tasks: regular recording of everyday life and evaluating memories to record those that are most meaningful. This led to the design of a mobile app to easily collect digital memories that already exist and allow the seamless incorporation of content from the physical world.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>Our initial paper prototype worked to address four components of our main two tasks: easy daily recording and evaluating memories to keep those that are most meaningful. First, people who use our app would need to create a profile and connect services that their content can come from. Next, they could use these services to choose elements best able to represent their day. Thirdly, they could incorporate any physical journal entries that they want to be able to easily look back on into their digital interface. Finally, they could navigate through old entries and search for specific memories. Connecting services and using these to add content to a day helps one achieve easy recording of memories, while selectively including elements of a diary and looking back on memories through search and calendar view address evaluating memories for reminiscing. Below are the screens depicting each of the four components described above which help people accomplish the two selected tasks.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<p>We started testing with an evaluation based on Nielsen’s heuristics to get feedback on the overall practicality and ease of use of the approach of our app. From this, we proceeded with a series of refinements on our design and usability tests to gather empirical data on how people interact with our design.</p>
<p>Our heuristic evaluation was conducted in class with another HCI student as the participant. Then, our usability testing involved three college-aged males: two were respondents to our initial survey about journaling and one was another HCI student.</p>
<p>In our initial usability test, we presented our participant with our design and prompted them to do a series of specific tasks. In the test, Lucia was the observer taking written notes, Patrick was the computer, Mitchell was the facilitator, and Dana the observer taking pictures and videos (with the permission of the participant). When appropriate, everyone prompted the participant with any clarifying questions they had.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the test, Dana explained the main idea of our project and what we would be asking him to do. She also asked if he was okay with us taking videos and photos. Then, we asked him to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new account</li>
<li>Add a new entry from an existing physical journal</li>
<li>Look back on a specific day</li>
<li>Search for memories related to “skiing”</li>
<li>Look at the stats for physical-journal memories</li>
<li>Unlink applications from his account</li>
</ol>
<p>In performing the tasks, we requested that the participant share his thought process. After he completed the tasks, we asked if he had any input on the design and if there were any tasks he found particularly confusing or unintuitive.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the focus of this first usability test gravitated heavily towards the basic functionality of the app, such as whether the buttons made intuitive sense, which may have been influenced by the heuristic evaluation mindset. Additionally, we felt that we provided a little too much context and guidance in the first usability test, which made it easy for the participant due to artificial subgoals and, in some situations, pre-given answers. Hence, we refined our process to focus more on testing for the two primary tasks, looking out for how well our prototype allowed participants to accomplish them. To account for the realizations about over-guidance, we decided to coach less, and when explaining tasks we made sure our language did not align with any labels on the screen, making the necessary adjustments in order to avoid accidental guiding.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement">Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</h3>
<p>Through our usability research we identified several issues surrounding our paper prototype. A majority of the issues centered around 3 themes. The first was icon clarity: assuring that the visual aspect of our icons clearly conveyed its action. The second was minimalistic design: advocating for a more simplistic application and removing clutter. And the last was consistency in screens: making sure all symbols and designs were uniform throughout screens.</p>
<p>The in-class heuristic evaluation mainly helped us in identifying consistency errors throughout our application (button/screen names, locations of navigation, etc.). Thus, before conducting our usability test, most of these issues were fixed. As stated, this addressed the theme of consistency in screens.</p>
<p>In our first usability test, we noticed that the participant was unclear on how to select/deselect parts of a physical journal entry. This issue was mainly an icon clarity problem but also pertained to minimalistic design. Because of this, we simplified the screen and used clearer action words to indicate the use of each button. Although not pictured, the after screen would portray a greyed out image of the journal entry. When the user would select the phrases he/she wanted, they would no longer be greyed out.</p>

</p>
<p>In our first and second usability test we discovered that participants were not sure about the difference between uploading from a physical journal and taking a photo. To make this clear, we made the icons and their captions connect more with the physical actions. In all, this was an icon clarity issue.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<p>Lastly, we discovered two main issues in our third usability test. The first was that the participant wished to return to the onboarding tutorial. This issue did not pertain to any of the themes, but we felt that it was important to include. Originally, these screens were only visible when the user signed-up. We subsequently added an option in the settings menu that would allow for this functionality. This is shown on the right-most screen where it says “review onboarding screens”.</p>

</div>
<p>Secondly, we found that the participant had difficulty knowing how to delete part of an entry. As part of our initial paper prototype, we had a swipe left functionality for delete. This was a minimalistic design issue. At first we wanted to create a very simple design but it was not intuitive for the participants. Because of this, we decided to incorporate an edit mode that would have a garbage icon to delete entries. We felt that this would be visually clear and more readily understood.</p>

</div>
<p>Overarching feedback from design critiques helped us address some of the layout, cluttering, and visual concerns associated with our design and further improve the prototype.</p>
<h3 id="final-paper-prototype">Final Paper Prototype:</h3>
<p>After our testing, we were able spot inconsistencies between screens and add functionality that helped users better accomplish the two tasks. Some critical aspects of the initial prototype include lack of clarity of some buttons and processes, such as adding scanned journal entries.</p>
<p>We refined how users accomplish the task of daily recording by adding a suggestions button, which would provide the option to auto-populate the day with entries drawn from different connected sources. Users can easily tap or drag those elements into their day, which saves them time. This contributes to the first task because one of the major pain points deterring people from journaling was how time consuming it is, so this suggestion feature aims to make recording more efficient.</p>

    alt="Final paper prototype screen that demonstrates the adding content flow." 
  >
</p>
<p>We also refined how users accomplish the task of evaluating and selecting memories they want to keep. Initially, we only had a way to add and share content, but did not have a way to delete added entries. We realized that people may at times like to go back to an old day and want to delete their past entries, or potentially undo an entry accidentally just added. This not only supports Nielsen’s heuristic of “Control and Freedom” but also our task because it allows users to remove unwanted memories or moments of regret.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="digital-mockup">Digital Mockup:</h3>
<p>In our digital mockup, we focused on the same two tasks as our paper prototype: regular recording of everyday life and evaluation of memories to actively highlight more valuable ones. We divided the mockup into several different views: onboarding, home and settings, adding content, deleting content, sharing content, calendar, search, and statistics. We address the tasks in each of these views.</p>
<p>In transitioning from our paper prototype to our digital mockup we had to make considerations about fonts and textures. We wanted to maintain the simplicity of our app, but use shadows to add a degree of texture and convey that certain elements are buttons. We also needed to make some changes regarding which menus and navigation were shown on each screen to abide by our theme of minimalistic design.</p>
<p>In the onboarding screens, we mainly focused on the first task. We felt that making onboarding fast and easy would make users more likely to record regularly. Additionally, we gave the option of linking different accounts so that a user can easily capture different parts of his/her life.</p>

<p>Adding content addressed the first task. It clarified how to record your day. This was accomplished through the simple “+” icon to add content.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

    src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/digital_day_1.jpg" width="100%" style="max-width: 200px; vertical-align: top;" class="m-3 border rounded"

    alt="Screen showing day's story after content was added, with option to add/delete/share." 
  >
</p>
<p>Delete and share content directly accomplishes task two. It allows a user to pick and choose what he/she wants to remember. For example, if a particular part of the day was not enjoyable, they could choose to delete that memory. This works vice-versa with a positive memory and sharing.</p>

  >
</p>
<p>Calendar, search, and statistics addresses both tasks. For the first task (regular recording), it provides a day, week, and month view for the user. We felt that this would aid regular recording because a user could see when and how often he/she has been recording. Secondly, the search and the statistics views allow a user to filter through memories. This provides a platform for a user to “evaluate memories and actively highlight more valuable ones.”</p>

<h3 id="problem-and-solution-overview"><strong><strong>Problem and Solution Overview:</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Studying is a universal struggle shared amongst students everywhere. Unfortunately, the fact that there is no universal best way to study makes this challenge even more difficult to solve. Also, technology is now often used in curriculums across all disciplines. Since technology (and more specifically, the internet) also can be a great distraction to students, for many students it can be incredibly difficult to manage staying on track when studying with tech-based resources.</p>
<p>When researching our design, we came up with the following three themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>There is no universal “best way to study.”</em></li>
<li><em>Studying in groups is often desirable, but can go poorly for a litany of reasons.</em></li>
<li><em>The internet is both a requirement to complete work and a major source of distractions.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These themes guided us in developing the tasks we could tackle with our design. Ultimately, we decided upon a design that focused upon tasks derived from the first and third themes. We excluded the second theme from our final design since we found that our designs that implemented group-studying functionality significantly shifted the scope and focus of our project away from improving the individual student’s study skills.</p>
<p>Our final design solution, Stud-e, is a personalized study advisor app that uses data recorded from past study sessions to help optimize students’ study session time usage with the assistance of a physical bracelet.</p>

</p>
<p>Above is our initial paper prototype. There are two main components for our prototype: our mobile app and our bracelet.  Below are overviews and walkthroughs of the two tasks we chose to refine our paper prototype around:</p>
<h4 id="task-1-overview"><strong><strong>Task 1 Overview</strong></strong></h4>
<p>The first task we focused upon in our design was receiving suggestions around study habits based upon previous study data. Our design derives these suggestions based on two primary sources:  applications and websites that the user consciously chooses to block, and users initiating a study session by indicating that they want to start “studying” (which triggers the app’s study-session data collection functionality).</p>
<p>If a user tries accessing a restricted website, stud-e knows to block access to it. However, if stud-e notices that you’re distracted on an unrestricted website during the study session it will remember the website and suggest blocking it in the future.</p>
<p>To prevent burnout, the app can also sense when users have been working too long and can suggest taking a break. This is because stud-e is not built to simply promote continual studying, but rather to promote healthy study habits through appropriately managing study breaks. stud-e achieves this during study sessions through the usage of a light-up bracelet. When in a study session, the bracelet turns green. If a user gets off-track/distracted while studying, the bracelet turns red to indicate to the user that he/she should get back to work. Once stud-e grants the user a break and the user then takes a break, the bracelet turns blue to indicate to the user that their current break-time is appropriate. If the break runs too long, the bracelet will turn red, indicating to the user that he/she needs to get back to work.</p>
<p>Once the user completes their study sesion, suggestions based upon the completed session are presented to the user. These suggestions typically contain advice derived from the prior session regarding study break usage and distracting websites. Accompanying these suggestions is a score derived from how productive the user was in the session.</p>

<p>This is the front page of stud-e. There is a list of tasks, with their respective progress bars, on the page. There is a settings icon on the top-left to show the current restrictions currently in place. Additionally, the buttons on the bottom allow for adding new tasks, data about past study suggestions, and analytics about the current study sessions.</p>

<p>When the student is ready to start studying, he or she clicks the start studying button.  The app and bracelet turn green.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>After some time, the student attempts to use one of the blocked apps. Upon doing so, he or she can see that the app is blocked by stud-e, and hence cannot access any of the app’s features.  The app and bracelet turn red.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>The student then attempts to access another app (Instagram) that is known by stud-e to be unproductive.  However, the student is still able to access all of the app's features for now.  After 5 minutes on Instagram, the student gets a pop-up on Instagram from stud-e, suggesting they should get back to studying and providing a button to help them do so.  The app and bracelet turn red again.</p>

<p>After making some progress and/or working for a long time, the app suggests the student to take a break. The student can take a break by clicking the button on the pop-up.  The app and bracelet turn blue.</p>

<p>The student has now finished the task. The student decides to stop studying by clicking the “end studying” button. Once clicked, the student can see suggestions on apps/websites to block in the future, as well as future study tips that may be helpful.</p>
<h4 id="task-2-overview"><strong><strong>Task 2 Overview</strong></strong></h4>
<p>The second task we focused upon in our design was managing lists of assignments/tasks. On the main screen of our app is a “task” list.  This list provides the user an overview of current tasks/assignments, a progress bar for each task to indicate task completion, and the due dates for each task.</p>
<p>Users can add new assignments/tasks to the list either by importing them from Canvas or through creating them manually from scratch. Additionally, all assignments also show a list of subtasks of a particular task.</p>

<p>As they work, they can check off subtasks in their project, the app will reflect their progress on the progress bar.</p>
<h3 id="testing-process"><strong><strong>Testing Process:</strong></strong></h3>
<p>To test our prototype, we completed two types of tests:  inspection-based heuristic evaluations and usability tests. We had three participants test our design. Our first two participants completed both types of tests, while our third participant only completed the usability test.</p>
<h4 id="participant-overview"><strong><strong>Participant Overview</strong></strong></h4>
<p>As mentioned above, we had three participants, whose names we have obscured for anonymity:</p>
<ul>
<li>J, a 4th year CSE Student from CSE440</li>
<li>A, a 2nd year CSE Student from CSE440</li>
<li>S, a 3rd year CSE Student from CSE440</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated before, J and A completed both Usability Tests and Heuristic Evaluations while S only completed a Usability Test.</p>
<h4 id="heuristic-evaluation-testing-process"><strong><strong>Heuristic Evaluation Testing Process</strong></strong></h4>
<p>When completing a heuristic evaluation, we provided the evaluator with a copy of the CSE440 sheet of design heuristics to evaluate our prototype with.  Since both of our Heuristic Evaluation tests were completed with classmates from CSE440, we did not have to bother nor worry too much about explaining how to conduct a Heuristic Evaluation to either of them.  Our evaluators completed their evaluations both passively with their Usability Tests and as their sole focus after they had completed their Usability tests.</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-process"><strong><strong>Usability Test Process</strong></strong></h4>
<p>For each of our Usability Tests, we initially made participants explore the prototype on their own for a few minutes and had them complete our two tasks.  When completing our Usability Tests, we had two roles:  listed below are each role alongside who took each role in each of the three tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitator/Computer: Traditionally, the Facilitator and Computer roles are separate when Usability Testing.  The Facilitator guides users through the test and prompts their thoughts while the Computer lays out the components for each element of the prototype.  In our testing, we decided to merge these two roles.
<ul>
<li>Test 1: Aerin</li>
<li>Test 2: Manan</li>
<li>Test 3: Julian and Manan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Observer: Notetaker during the test.
<ul>
<li>Test 1: Manan</li>
<li>Test 2: Manan</li>
<li>Test 3: John</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We debriefed with each participant for a few minutes afterwards, asking them questions regarding what he/she felt should be added/removed/changed about our design.</p>
<h4 id="usability-testing-process-refinement"><strong><strong>Usability Testing Process Refinement</strong></strong></h4>
<p>For the first test, before we did anything we walked the user through the various features and functionalities of the app.  When reflecting upon our first test, we realized that by doing this we effectively ruined that test’s usefulness in determining the intuitiveness of our design.</p>
<p>For our second and third tests, we did not provide the participants with any sort of walkthrough of the app beforehand (so we could see how easy our app was to understand).  Instead, we had the participants jump right into working upon our two tasks.  We typically gave guidance in these two tests along the way only if the participant got stuck for a while trying to figure out what to do next.  This more quality results than the first test regarding the intuitiveness of our design.</p>
<p>For our third test, we let the participant explore the app a bit after completing the tasks because we had some spare class time (Test 3 was completed in Quiz Section).  This exploration yielded interesting critiques from the participant about aspects of our design that were not necessarily used to complete our two tasks.  We feel that we ultimately got some of our most useful critiques from our third Usability Test because we had the participant complete this exploration of our design.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement"><strong><strong>Testing Results and Prototype Refinement:</strong></strong></h3>
<p>For each of the following subsections, we will first present the various critiques of our design accompanied by the respective changes made as a result of each critique.  After presenting these critiques, there will be summaries of the overarching themes we derived from these critiques about how we needed to adjust our design.  If you don't feel like reading too many of the details/are short on time, feel free to skip the full critique breakdown to get to the summaries for some TL;DRs.</p>

<hr />
<h5 id="summary-of-results-overarching-themes"><strong><strong>Summary of Results/Overarching Themes</strong></strong></h5>
<p>Across these critiques there were two themes that primarily stood out:</p>
<h6 id="unclear-navigation-ui"><strong><strong>Unclear Navigation UI</strong></strong></h6>
<p>The strongest theme across these critiques was that our UI was not the most intuitive to navigate.  Users were unable to figure out how to access the various functionalities of the app, were unable to edit the tasks they created, and were unable to back out of the current context of the app when desired.  We fixed these UI problems by adding a hamburger button that popped open an explicitly labelled list of app navigation icons, adding “X” and back-arrow buttons to certain screens, and adding an “edit” button to the task screen.  We believe these fixes worked:  in further testing, navigation proved to no longer be a problem.</p>
<h6 id="inconsistent-wording"><strong><strong>Inconsistent Wording</strong></strong></h6>
<p>A second, but major theme of the critiques was that the usage of the terms “Project”, “Task”, and “Subtask” throughout the prototype was inconsistent, incorrect, and confusing.  The usage was so confusing, in fact, that some users critiqued that we should add already present functionality that they could not find due to the usage of the wrong term.  After receiving these critiques, we went through our design and revised our terminology usage.  We did not have any problems with terminology in further testing.</p>

<h5 id="summary-of-results-overarching-themes-2"><strong><strong>Summary of Results/Overarching Themes</strong></strong></h5>
<p>Below are two themes derived from the above critiques:</p>
<h6 id="interpreting-study-session-success"><strong><strong>Interpreting Study Session Success</strong></strong></h6>
<p>Throughout all of these critiques, one main theme became apparent:  our design did not quantify and display the recorded data in a way our users found extremely useful.  Based upon our critiques, we gradually overhauled our feedback mechanism to be more readable/concise (through a “score” mechanism and bar graph usage) and more in-depth (through feedback pages and assignment work-time estimates) than before.  We felt that fixing these complaints was crucial since a major part of our design (self-improvement via reading reports on past sessions) depends upon users being able to easily and quickly interpret the data presented to them.</p>
<h6 id="missing-elements"><strong><strong>Missing Elements</strong></strong></h6>
<p>Some critiques of our design centered around the fact that we did not have certain screens available to interact with in our paper prototype (for example, the “Edit Task” screen and the date-specific “Study Feedback” screen were missing).  To accommodate these critiques, we decided to create these missing elements of our paper prototype.</p>

<p>After some time, the student attempts to use one of the blocked apps. Upon doing so, he or she can see that the app is blocked by stud-e, and hence cannot access any of the app’s features.  The app and bracelet turn red.</p>
<p style="display: block; margin: auto; text-align: center;">

<p>The student then attempts to access another app (Instagram) that is known by stud-e to be unproductive.  However, the student is still able to access all of the app's features for now.  After 5 minutes on Instagram, the student gets a pop-up on Instagram from stud-e, suggesting they should get back to studying and providing a button to help them do so.  The app and bracelet turn red again.</p>

<h5 id="changes-from-paper-prototype-to-digital-mockup"><strong><strong>Changes From Paper Prototype to Digital Mockup</strong></strong></h5>
<p>Below is an overview of the changes we made to our design in the process of transitioning our design from a Paper Prototype to a Digital Mockup.</p>
<h6 id="changes-relevant-to-task-1"><strong><strong>Changes Relevant to Task 1</strong></strong></h6>
<p>As before, our first task consists of giving users suggestions based on their past study data. In our shift from a paper prototype to a digital mockup, we added in a log in screen, changed the layout of our restricted apps/website page, and improved the final study suggestions page in order to make the data a little more user-readable.</p>
<h6 id="changes-relevant-to-task-2"><strong><strong>Changes Relevant to Task 2</strong></strong></h6>
<p>Our second task involves creating and organizing task lists for user assignments. We directly translated our main task list page over and refined the process of creating new tasks.</p>
<h6 id="other-changes"><strong><strong>Other Changes</strong></strong></h6>
<p>There are many minor changes we made to our design when creating the design mockup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of our navigation features (bracelet settings, restrictions, task list, etc.) were moved into our hamburger menu.</li>
<li>Made our logo more colorful to incorporate more color into our design.</li>
<li>Designed, created, and added operationally-necessary pages that were not initially part of our paper prototypes such as a log-in screen and a bracelet-pairing screen.</li>
<li>Increased the user’s ability to edit more than just tasks/subtasks throughout the app by increasing the presence of edit buttons.</li>
<li>Increased the presence of the bracelet in the design of our software (for example, the app shows the bracelet’s remaining charge).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Tidy's primary objective  is to simplify household management among shared living spaces such as dorms, apartments, and houses. In many of these living situations, the lack of individual accountability can lead to miscommunication, disorganization, and unwelcome roommate tension. A household management platform such as Tidy would not only increase the livability of a household, but also alleviate potential disputes and help maintain relationships. Aspects of shared living that Tidy focuses on include automatic chore delegation and chore accountability. While we did not fully explore these features in our final mockup, future iterations of Tidy could also include finance management and schedule features..</p>
<p>Our solution to these household issues takes the form of a smartphone application, which leverages the convenience and universal adoption of smartphones. Through our design research, we discovered that common issues with our interface stemmed from a lack of both internal and external consistency. Our research also led us to narrow Tidy's focus to chore management specifically, as designs that included various additional household management features proved to be too cluttered and confusing for users to navigate. As a result, our final digital mockup represents a balance between the themes of minimalism, accessibility, and functionality.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>After deciding upon our smartphone application design, we began brainstorming ideas for our paper prototype. Our initial goal was lofty - to create a comprehensive household management application that offered all household-related functionalities, including chores, finances, scheduling, and messaging. The two tasks we chose to focus on were maintaining chore accountability and managing shared finances, so we concentrated on these aspects of in prototype.</p>

<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<h4 id="heuristic-evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
<p>A heuristic evaluation was held to identify any transparent issues in the design before any interactions with it take place. Because evaluators needed a general understanding of the issues to look out, our participants were limited to those familiar with the process (i.e. CSE 440 students). We began our tests by walking the participants through the general design flow and explained the basic functionalities supported by our design. The participants were then asked to evaluate the design based on a predetermined list of heuristics.</p>
<h4 id="usability-tests">Usability Tests</h4>
<p>We conducted our first usability test with a current senior studying Aeronautics and Aerospace Engineering from the University of Washington at Odegaard Undergraduate Library, as it was an accessible location for the participant. He currently lives with his family, but has experience living with roommates.</p>
<p>Our second usability test was conducted in section with a fellow CSE 440 student. This student is a junior at the University of Washington and has experience in developing both user interfaces and paper prototypes. Both the participant and testing location were preset by the course staff.</p>
<p>Our third usability test participant is a current senior at the University of Washington who currently lives with six housemates in an off-campus house. Because this participant’s living situation matches our target demographic, it allowed us to gather direct insight as to whether our design is suitable for our user group. The test was conducted in Mary Gates Hall due to its accessibility and convenience for our participant.</p>
<p>Each usability test began with a brief introduction to the design and goals for the test. Participants were encouraged to share what they were thinking aloud during the execution of the tasks we set for them and following the test, debriefed with test overseers about any lingering thoughts or confusion they had about the current prototype.</p>
<h4 id="testing-process-changes">Testing Process Changes</h4>
<p>For every iteration of our tests besides our initial heuristic evaluation, we produced a revised paper prototype based on results from the prior test. This allowed us to reduce the volume of similar insights we would gather from subsequent tests and enabled us to focus on a different set of tasks for the next test. In our first usability test, the person acting as the “computer” was not aware of all possible interactions with the paper prototype. To prevent confusion in later tests, we performed several practice runs with the latest revision of the prototype to ensure that the “computer” felt comfortable with all of the prototype’s functions. We also decided to rotate roles throughout the testing process in hopes of provoking new insights.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement">Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</h3>
<p>During our heuristic evaluations, we discovered design flaws resulting from a lack of outside perspective during the creation of our initial design. One flaw we discovered was a failure to match our design to the real world. For example, the &quot;chores&quot; icon in the navigation bar was initially represented by a coat hanger. Our testing revealed that no one instinctively associates this icon with chores. We fixed this general issue by representing more sections of the interface using plain text and revising our navigation icons. A second issue that the heuristic evaluations revealed was a lack of internal consistency. In the pictures below, you can see a dollar sign and a check mark both being used to &quot;confirm&quot; similar tasks, which confused our participants. As a result, maintaining consistency became a focus of the remainder of the design process.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/webImage38.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>After our usability tests, we found that the scope of our project was too broad, which led our interface to be cluttered and unintuitive. Because we included various finance-related functionalities and basic messaging features on top of chore management, our participant's mental model of the app was heavily divided between different modes. We also realized that existing popular products such as Venmo and Facebook Messenger already offered these features, so we decided to shift Tidy's focus away from these areas.</p>
<p>Another issue we found related to the task of chore prioritization. While participants were typically able to successfully complete the task, most did not understand the significance of doing so. To address this problem, we emphasized the idea that chores were arranged based on priority and added a notification feature that sends push notifications to household members when their chore is &quot;prioritized&quot;.</p>
<p>Another major problem we encountered was a failure to correctly set up our participant's mental model. Because the household creation and chore preference settings were back to back in the setup process, our participant was unable to distinguish between the purposes of the two tasks. Rather than setting his own personal preferences, our participant thought that he was setting household-wide preferences, making him the &quot;household authority figure&quot;. This discrepancy between our design's perceived purpose and the intended purpose negatively influenced our participant's interaction with the design, even after the initial setup. To solve this problem, we clearly separated the two tasks by moving the chore preference selection to the user profile page, distinguishing it from the initial household setup process.</p>
<p>Another change we decided to make based on usability testing was the removal of the picture confirmation to mark a chore as completed. We received feedback that this feature felt like a burden on the usability of the design and would be completely unnecessary in a house with a basic foundation of trust.</p>
<h4 id="themes-in-testing-results">Themes in Testing Results</h4>
<p>One of the most difficult considerations regarding the participants' attention and time was the balance between functionality and tedium. Every effort to provide additional functionality came with some kind of cost in terms of the participants' time or attention. We found this to be a fundamental challenge - how do we provide useful user feedback while maintaining an intuitive user experience when interacting with the design? When deciding how to approach this problem, we ended up focusing on allowing the user to interact with it on their own terms.</p>
<p>The most notable theme across our testing results was what we entitled muddied mental models. Across all iterations of our prototypes, we struggled to set up mental models for our participants that accurately reflected the design's intended purpose. In our early tests, this was demonstrated by an over-division of the mental model from the wide range tasks that our prototype attempted to support. This was addressed by iteratively moving towards an emphasis on chore management, with clear navigation to guide users toward this focus. In later usability tests, an oversight in the chore preference setup process misled participants from the actual intended purpose. We struggled with this problem throughout the entire design process and worked tirelessly to ensure that Tidy's manifest model offered a clear and intentional purpose for future users.</p>
<h3 id="final-paper-prototype">Final Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>We understood that our final paper prototype would function as a guideline for the digital mockup. So, during the development of this final iteration we worked to implement a minimalist aesthetic to give ourselves more freedom to develop visual ideas in the mockup. Despite our minimalist focus, we were intentional about maintaining basic design elements that were in our original designs to ensure that that they would be carried over to the final product.</p>

</p>
<p>From the profile page, participants drag and drop chores to adjust their preferences. The participant is brought back to the main chore page, where chores are automatically delegated as members join.</p>
<h3 id="digital-mockup">Digital Mockup</h3>
<p>As we transitioned from our paper prototype to the digital mockup, we decided to change an aspect of the household setup process. We felt like our current solution for how users were inputting what types of chores were required in their household was not optimized. Previously users would have to type out each individual chore and the instructions to go along with it. However, while we were in the process of making our mockups we thought it would be better to let users select from a set of common chores with an option to add more chores if necessary. We did not get to user test this idea, but we believe it helps maximize the efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>As the use of electronic cigarettes and vaporizers becomes more popular among teenagers, youths, and people who replaced traditional smoking with e-cigarettes, there is a need for consumers to easily track their consumption and provide insights for those who would like to quit or maintain their nicotine consumption.
Our design research showed that social motivation influences if and when individuals start and stop vaping, but there is currently no tool that helps those who use e-cigarettes or vaporizers quit. Based on this research and several design ideas, our final design is a smartphone application and a physical component. Which allows users to keep track of their nicotine intake, see their progress through the data collected in the VapeWeight application, and provides a community forum and messaging to allow users on the app to help each other become vape free.</p>
<h3 id="initial-paper-prototype">Initial Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>The following prototypes show the initial designs of the physical component that weighs the e-liquid, and the application that is connected to by Bluetooth. The application is working based on the two main tasks that we considered earlier.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/component.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="task-1-auto-tracking">Task 1: Auto-Tracking</h4>
<p>This prototype illustrates the first main task which shows how a person can access their Dashboard where the synced data is after they set up their account.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/prototype-task1.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h4 id="task-2-accountability-and-support">Task 2: Accountability and Support</h4>
<p>This prototype illustrates the second main task which outlines the main features of the app pertaining to community, support, and personal accountability.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/prototype-task2.png" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="testing-process">Testing Process</h3>
<h4 id="usability-test-1">Usability Test 1</h4>
<p>The first participant is a 19-year-old male student at the University of Washington in a fraternity who would like to quit vaping eventually but would like to monitor his usage first, making him a perfect participant in our test. The study was conducted in Odegaard library as it was a convenient location for our group and for himself to meet, and our prototype is meant to be used at any location. We had our participant work on two separate tasks: onboarding a device and tracking vape usage. Shariya gave the initial introduction and explanation of tasks to the participant, while Angela took notes, Molly moved the prototype pieces around, and Niloofar addressed concerns and answered questions from him.</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-2">Usability Test 2</h4>
<p>The second participant is a 17-year-old female high school student. They want to quit vaping because they spend too much money on it, and plan to quit at the same time as friends. We conducted the study at the participant’s house. We chose to test the app from a high schooler’s perspective because they grew up with technology and can easily tell if the app is working smoothly. They are also the most likely age to quit as a group, so we wanted to ensure that they would use the social aspect of the app. We had her go through the app first onboarding a device, then we asked her to go to her feed, and go to the menu with groups. Shariya gave the overview to the participants while Molly and Niloofar took notes and Angela moved the prototype pieces. We all were talking and asking questions throughout.</p>
<h4 id="usability-test-3">Usability Test 3</h4>
<p>The third participant is a 22-year-old female college student who is a current vape user and is eager to quit. We met her in Mary Gates Hall and had the opportunity to go over the whole prototype. She made a perfect candidate to test our prototype due to her age and history with peer-influenced vaping habits. During this usability test, Shariya and Niloofar arranged the paper prototype, while Angela and Molly took notes of her feedback and asked her clarifying questions.</p>
<h4 id="testing-refinement">Testing Refinement</h4>
<p>Throughout each test, we made small changes to how we conducted the usability tests. We initially conducted tests with classmates and asked basic questions about placement and aesthetics and used that information to refine the paper-prototype. With the refined prototype we conducted usability tests on people who were most likely to use the app. We asked tailored tasks to each person who falls in the group most likely to use that feature so we would have the most accurate situation.</p>
<h3 id="testing-results-and-prototype-refinement">Testing Results and Prototype Refinement</h3>
<p>Based on the feedback from our first usability test, we plan on expanding our onboarding process of the physical device to the app and updating our model of the vape usage data. We added a place to indicate the brand of cartridge used or manual input if our app does not have data on the user’s particular brand or cartridge type. This will allow our physical device to accurately track data. We also switched our vape usage graph to the percentage used as opposed to the percent left throughout the day, as well as including a note for the user’s peak hours.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/test1_1.jpeg" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/test1_3.jpeg" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>According to the feedback from our second usability test, we decided to have the main titles in tiles so she can see all of her options from the social setting rather than having menus which are harder to see and find. Also, we planned to change the name from “Groups” to “Social” for listing the social option as well as changing the wording of some texts as necessary.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/test2.jpeg" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Finally, our last participant from the third usability test stated that the first few pages of our design - which guide the user to set up their accounts and physical component - had too much text. She also recommended having a back button on each page rather than pressing the home page or tab the user needed each time. Therefore, we consolidated the amount of text in the setup process and added a back button at the top of each page.</p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/test3_1.jpeg" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="assets/projects/{{ project.path }}/test3_2.jpeg" width="100%" style="max-width: 500px; display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<h3 id="final-paper-prototype">Final Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>Our final paper prototype gave us an opportunity to consider all of our feedback from testing and incorporate it into our design. We made some visual changes according to our usability tests, which suggested that users preferred to see the amount left within their cartridge versus the amount of cartridge vaped within the usage period (day/week/month). One of the most thorough changes made was to our Social pages. Initially, our language was confusing (“Groups” vs “Community”) and the social menu was hidden within the Groups page. We added a landing page for all social categories and updated the language to consistently be “Social”.</p>
<p>Aside from the changes made to the main features of the mobile application, we also incorporated the suggestions from our usability tests to improve our onboarding process. We minimized the text to only include what we considered necessary and added more personalization options to the profile setup page.</p>

<h3 id="digital-mockup">Digital Mockup</h3>
<p>Our digital mockup was probably the most fun aspect of this whole project. It gave us a chance to focus more on the aesthetic of the application and perfect it to how we had imagined it, but couldn’t always draw on paper just right. We used Figma to create our mockup and learned a lot about the importance of consistency. We found that if our application had gotten much bigger, we would have needed a well-documented Style Guide to keep track of fonts, colors, and sizing. For the mockup, we focused on the two tasks of 1) automatic tracking, and 2) social accountability. For the social aspect, we highlighted the process of navigating to the Groups area, the Discussions, and how to create a new post. We also highlighted other features our application would include within the Social area, such as Friends, Messages, and Chat. For automatic tracking, we included the initial onboarding for a new user which walks them through the setup of their physical VapeWeight device and pairs it to the app using Bluetooth. After the pairing is complete, users are directed to an introduction of their Dashboard (essentially the home screen). The Dashboard contains the user’s most up-to-date information at a glance, including an overview of their vape usage and any new social notifications. From their Dashboard, users can click the “Track” button which navigates them to the automatic tracking section of the application. Users can then choose to view their data in List or Detail view, and can gain insights such as peak vaping hours, equivalent number of cigarettes smoked, and if they are above or below their average use.</p>
