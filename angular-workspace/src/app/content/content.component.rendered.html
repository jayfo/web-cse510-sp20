<h2 id="exam">Exam</h2>
<p>An at-home open-book exam will give an opportunity to demonstrate and apply your understanding of course material in a more substantial format.
It requires you to connect concepts across course readings, serving as an evaluation of your understanding and critical thinking about course concepts.
If you have kept pace with the readings, you will find this exam much easier to approach
(e.g., simply referring back to readings, rather than needing to understand them from scratch).
You may reference any of the articles, slides, notes, discussion posts, or other material readily available on the web.
You may consult the course staff with any questions, but this is strictly an individual assignment (i.e., do not discuss it with others).</p>

<ng-template #project>
<!--
<div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">

<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>A course project will be a major component of your work.
This will require hands-on experience with HCI, while remaining open to different possibilities.</p>
<p>Because we assume you are new to HCI research, we do not necessarily expect you to produce publishable work.
Instead, the expectation is that you will do something interesting.
It is then up to you to define interesting according to what you want to accomplish in this project, while seeking appropriate feedback from staff.
For example, you might choose to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and implement a new piece of HCI technology.</li>
<li>Design and execute an appropriately compelling study with HCI research implications.</li>
<li>Perform a feasibility analysis or pilot study to inform future research plans.</li>
<li>Replicate an existing study or technology.</li>
<li>Execute a sufficiently interesting design problem (i.e., focusing on design without regard to research novelty).</li>
</ul>
<p>We expect most students will do projects in groups of three.
We will consider groups of two, and we will generally not allow individual projects due to limited class time and resources.
Working in groups is a necessary part of doing research, and it is also important for the logistics of this course.</p>
<h3 id="project-ideas">Project Ideas</h3>
<p>Some sample project ideas, gathered from faculty and researchers, have been made available here:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ site.linkProjectProposalIdeas }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>
<p>You can also use that discussion to identify potential project partners and to post your own ideas.</p>
<h2 id="project-deliverables">Project Deliverables</h2>
<p>Project deliverables are defined in terms of a proposal, a pair of self-defined milestones, and a final report.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposal:       <app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ site.calendar.dueProjectProposal }}"></app-assignment-due-text></li>
<li>Milestone 1:    <app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ site.calendar.dueProjectMilestone1 }}"></app-assignment-due-text></li>
<li>Milestone 2:    <app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ site.calendar.dueProjectMilestone2 }}"></app-assignment-due-text></li>
<li>Final Report:   <app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ site.calendar.dueProjectReport }}"></app-assignment-due-text></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
<p>Your proposal will define your initial plan for this project.
You can and should update this plan based on feedback, progress, and findings.
The proposal therefore needs to demonstrate a robust initial plan for your project,
but your project is expected to evolve as appropriate and necessary.</p>
<p>You are welcome and even encouraged to align your project with your research goals outside this course.
However, it is critical to define what you will specifically accomplish in the course project.
The course project must stand on its own even if drawn from a larger research context.</p>
<p>Proposals consist of a short document and a short in-class presentation.</p>
<h3 id="proposal-document">Proposal Document</h3>
<p>Prepare a 1 page document addressing the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>What makes the project interesting? What is the problem or research question?</em></p>
<p>What is the pain point you want to solve, the new capability you want to enable, or the research you want to explore?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What existing understanding of the problem has been developed?</em></p>
<p>For a research proposal, this will briefly cover the most important related work in the space you are exploring.</p>
<p>For a design proposal, this will introduce existing solutions, why they fall short, and the potential opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What milestones will the group plan to accomplish?</em></p>
<p>There are two milestone reports in the quarter, one early and one late.
These are opportunities for feedback and guidance from staff and classmates.</p>
<p>Explain what your group will plan to accomplish by each of these milestones.
You will be asked to revisit these plans during those milestone reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>What might the group explicitly decide to omit?</em></p>
<p>Progress requires compromise, as you cannot accomplish everything.
Explain what aspects of the project you might choose to ignore or defer in this course.
This is your opportunity to scope the project appropriately for this course.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proposal-presentation">Proposal Presentation</h3>
<p>Prepare a presentation consisting of 3 to 4 slides. Each group will give a short in-class presentation.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates.
Your presentation should cover the same information as the document.
Our primary goal is feedback, not a formal presentation. Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful, and engaged.</p>
<h3 id="proposal-samples">Proposal Samples</h3>
<p>Sample project proposals from prior offerings have been made available here:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ site.linkProjectProposalSamples }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>
<h3 id="proposal-early-feedback">Proposal Early Feedback</h3>
<p>Course staff will be available to meet and provide early feedback as desired.</p>
<p>Meeting is optional.
You can also email to request feedback or to inquire about arranging another time to meet.
Sign up for the reserved meeting times here:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ site.linkProjectProposalEarlyFeedback }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>
<h3 id="proposal-submission">Proposal Submission</h3>

<h2 id="milestone-reports">Milestone Reports</h2>
<p>Two milestone reports serve as a check on the trajectory of your project
and an opportunity for feedback and guidance from staff and classmates.
Convey the state of your project and your plans for the remainder of the quarter.</p>
<p>Milestone reports consist of a short document and a short in-class presentation.</p>
<h3 id="milestone-document">Milestone Document</h3>
<p>Prepare a 1 page document addressing the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you have done for this milestone, discussing current progress relative to previously stated plans.</li>
<li>What you will do before your next milestone, including any revisions based on your status or findings.</li>
<li>Any areas where you could use advice or are blocked.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="milestone-presentation">Milestone Presentation</h3>
<p>Prepare a presentation consisting of 3 to 4 slides. Each group will give a short in-class presentation.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates.

<h2 id="final-report">Final Report</h2>
<p>Prepare a final report that is 4 to 10 pages in length, excluding references.</p>
<p>Your final report should be presented in the same general structure as the papers you read this quarter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction and Motivation</li>
<li>Statement of Contributions</li>
<li>Related Work</li>
<li>Description / Methods / Results</li>
<li>Discussion / Future Work / Conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>Write according to the content you have.
Be appropriately thorough and precise in your presentation, but do not needlessly pad your text.</p>
<p>Format your report according to the current CHI format:</p>
<p><a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/">https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/</a></p>

<h2 id="readings-and-reading-reports">Readings and Reading Reports</h2>
<p>Assigned readings will focus on research topics, generally consisting of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A framing paper:
presenting a theory, language, or understanding that can contextualize the contributions of additional research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two papers with more recent or specific contributions:
presenting the type of contribution you might initially be expected to attempt in your research.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are expected to read: (1) the framing paper, and (2) either of the more recent papers
(in other words, whichever seems more compelling or interesting to you). You obviously may choose to read all three.
The calendar will link to assigned readings and provide any day-specific revisions to this reading structure.</p>
<p>You are expected to have read and considered the assigned readings prior to class,
as the in-class discussions are a critical component of this course.
To help prepare for an engaging and meaningful discussion, we also assign Reading Reports.</p>
<h3 id="reading-reports">Reading Reports</h3>
<p>To help prepare for an engaging and meaningful discussion, we require posting thoughts and questions beforehand.
You can start a new discussion, participate in an existing discussion, or do a bit of both.
You can discuss all of the assigned readings, or focus on a portion of the reading that you found most interesting.
The important part is that we can see intellectual effort in your forum participation, not just a simple paper summary.</p>
<p>Reading reports are generally expected to be approximately 200 to 400 words.
which may be in a single post or distributed across several posts related to a day's readings.
We expect most will be short and focused on discussion points or questions,
and posts that problematically exceed the upper limit or primarily summarize the reading itself will receive low grades.
This aims to strike a balance between:
(1) enough text to convey a meaningful response, and
(2) succinct enough to allow review before class.</p>
<p>Your participation in the forum discussion for each day will be graded on a scale from 0 to 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>0: If you do not participate.</li>
<li>1: If your participation seems weak and does not convince us you read, understood, and considered the readings.</li>
<li>2: If your participation shows you read and understood the readings and had something interesting to say.
This will be the most common grade.</li>
<li>3: Reserved for especially insightful participation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is generally easy to find something to criticize in any piece of research.
But focusing exclusively on the potential flaws of research is generally not productive.
You will generally find it more intellectually worthwhile to focus on aspects of work that are particularly well done,
new ideas are prompted by a piece of work, or what you might have done differently if you conducted the research.
This will also lead to much more valuable discussions.</p>
<p>Potential topics for discussion are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What idea or innovation enabled this, what more might be done based on that idea or innovation?</li>
<li>What new questions or research agendas are suggested by this research?</li>
<li>How might this research have informed some other research you have seen?</li>
<li>What aspects of this work were particularly well done or effective?</li>
<li>If you had conducted this research, what would you have done differently?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also note that some papers will be presented by authors of those papers.
Although we want everybody to be comfortable with open discussion,
and we do not expect posts to be overly formal,
this is another reason to be thoughtful in how you approach paper discussion.</p>
<p>Discussions will be coordinated using Canvas:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ site.linkDiscussion }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>
<p>We will create a post for each day and a discussion thread for each paper.
If you have a thought or question that relates to multiple papers, post it wherever seems more appropriate.</p>
<p>Reading reports are due at 11:59pm the night before each class meeting.
This ensures time the next morning to review discussion before class.
Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore unacceptable and risks zero credit.</p>

<h2 id="statistics-lab">Statistics Lab</h2>
<p>To aid in developing necessary skills, you will complete a small statistics lab using <app-generated-link linkHREF="//www.r-project.org/">R</app-generated-link>.
The lab will walk you through analyzing an example data set,
and you will then analyze two datasets from published research papers.</p>
<p>You will gain basic familiarity with analyzing experiments using mixed‑model analyses of variance.
Consistent with lecture, this assignment is not intended to provide complete knowledge of how to design
or analyze experiments, which is far beyond the scope of one lecture or assignment.
This assignment is instead focused on a pragmatic introduction to analyzing
experiments based in designs you might later find useful.
Please consider this assignment in the context of the material covered in lecture, as not all of it is repeated here.</p>
<p>In addition to the lecture material and the contents of this assignment,
you might benefit from working through all or part of
Jacob Wobbrock's independent study in Practical Statistics for Human-Computer Interaction.</p>

      <p>
        <app-reading [reading]="currentReading"></app-reading>

  </ul>

<h3 id="non-standard-reading-format">Non-Standard Reading Format</h3>
<p>Each student has two responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organize into groups of 2 to briefly present one of the above vision papers. Sign up for a paper here:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ site.linkVisionsOrganization }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>
<p>It is critical to remember most people will not have read the paper you are presenting.
It is therefore your responsibility to explain the vision.
One useful way of breaking down and explaining the vision might be to discuss these four points:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the status quo at the time the authors wrote this?</li>
<li>What was the author’s vision of future technologies?</li>
<li>How has this vision played out since this publication?</li>
<li>How might this vision continue to play out in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit your presentation as 3 to 4 slides in PDF, PPT, or PPTX format:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ site.linkSubmitVisions }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Individually read at least one more of the above vision papers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because &quot;As We May Think&quot; was presented as part of the previous lecture, you may not present it. You may still choose to read it.</p>
<p>No reading report is assigned.
Reading a second paper benefits in-class discussion.
helping you see these visions and explore them appropriately.
Because some of these papers are quite long, you can and should skim according to your needs.</p>
