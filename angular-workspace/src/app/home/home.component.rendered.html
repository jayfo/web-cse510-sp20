<h2 id="project-theme">Project Theme</h2>
<p>The theme for projects in this course is <strong>self-tracking and everyday interaction with personal intelligences</strong>.</p>
<p>People have long sought to better understand themselves, but continuing technology advances enable new approaches.
Students will examine problems people encounter in gathering and gaining value from personal data,
then explore how a combination of design and machine intelligence can
help go beyond simple data fetishes to help people in using personal data as part of reaching their goals.</p>
<p>Understanding and designing for self-tracking is also known as personal informatics:</p>

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>
      Personal informatics systems are systems that help people collect 
      personally relevant information for the purpose of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge.

    </footer>
  </blockquote>

<p>Self-tracking and personal informatics are related to the <app-generated-link linkHREF="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</app-generated-link> movement, which describes itself as:</p>

  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>
      Self-knowledge through numbers.
    </p>

    </footer>
  </blockquote>

<p>Instead of limiting self-tracking to dashboards for an isolated self-analyst,
consider the many different ways people might gather and interact with personal data,
together with how machine intelligence might add meaningful value to these activities.</p>
<p>Tracking can therefore take many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>wearable sensors</li>
<li>phone and watch applications</li>
<li>appliances and other artifacts in the environment</li>
<li>hybrid and multi-device forms (e.g., mobile capture with later annotation or review)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracking can include many social contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>people seeking help from peers (e.g., social sharing, support networks)</li>
<li>people seeking help from experts (e.g., health providers)</li>
<li>co-located relationships (e.g., families, friends, co-workers)</li>
<li>remote relationships (e.g., families, friends, co-workers)</li>
<li>communities organizing (e.g., people in a building, community volunteers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracking can explore new forms of interaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>conversational interfaces</li>
<li>tangible interfaces</li>
<li>ubiquitous computing interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Any problem where people gather or seek value in personal data
introduces opportunities and challenges in designing for effective interaction around that data.
It can also present opportunities and challenges in
how integrated machine intelligence can provide meaningful value to that individual.</p>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Strive to do good work because you care about your own opportunities to learn,
including the opportunities this course provides working with a group in an intensive project.</p>
<p>The overall course grade will be computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>65%</strong>: Group Project
<ul>
<li><strong>3%</strong>: Assignment 1, Project Proposal
<ul>
<li>1a: Proposal Brainstorm (0.5%)</li>
<li>1b: Project Proposal (2.5%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>20%</strong>: Assignment 2, Getting the Right Design
<ul>
<li>2a: Design Ideation (graded as part of Participation)</li>
<li>2b: Design Research Plan (2%)</li>
<li>2c: Design Research Check-In (1%)</li>
<li>2d: Design Research Review (2%)</li>
<li>2e: Task Review (1%)</li>
<li>2f: Design Check-In (3%)</li>
<li>2g: Design Review (1%)</li>
<li>2web: Getting the Right Design (10%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>18%</strong>: Assignment 3, Getting the Design Right
<ul>
<li>3a: Paper Prototype (2%)</li>
<li>3b: Heuristic Evaluation (graded as part of 3c)</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>12%</strong>: Assignment 4, Communicating the Design
<ul>
<li>4a: Initial Poster and Pitch (2%)</li>
<li>4b: Initial Video (2%)</li>
<li>4c: Final Poster and Pitch (4%)</li>
<li>4d: Final Video (4%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>12%</strong>: Presentations
<ul>
<li>2p: Getting the Right Design Presentation (5%)</li>
<li>3p: Getting the Design Right Presentation (5%)</li>
<li>Individual Presentation Score (2%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>10%</strong>: Participation</li>
<li><strong>25%</strong>: Exam</li>
</ul>
<p>Each assignment will also provide a point breakdown intended to convey how it will be graded.
Design is an inherently subjective practice, and so grading in this course is necessarily subjective.
The stated project requirements are the minimum,
intended to leave room for groups to earn strong grades through strong work.</p>
<p>Because the course is designed around feedback on project milestones, grades given to those milestones indicate
that you have invested sufficient effort and insight at the time of the milestone.
You will get feedback and are expected to continue acting upon that feedback in your design process.
The bulk of project grades is therefore attached to the final deliverables, which are evaluated on their quality.</p>
<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>Many assignments are due &quot;the night before class&quot;. We will implement this in Canvas as 11:59pm.</p>
<p>This is a fast-paced course, with many elements of the project depending on prior elements.
Similarly, the course staff's ability to give feedback relies on timely submissions
(e.g., course staff will often review your submission in the morning before section).
Submitting the day of class, just before class, or in class is therefore generally unacceptable.
Course staff will attempt to be flexible where appropriate, but any late submission risks receiving zero credit.</p>
<p>Submissions will generally be in PDF format (i.e., not plain text, not Word).
The PDF should be printable, containing everything we need to review and grade the assignment (e.g., your name).
The course staff has a large number of submissions to manage, so format and completeness issues are problematic.</p>
<h2 id="groups-and-contribution">Groups and Contribution</h2>
<p>We expect groups to take collective responsibility and to resolve any coordination issues.
The course staff is always happy to make suggestions with regard to your effort and coordination.
If an issue needs to be raised with the course staff, we expect it to be raised early enough to be addressed.</p>
<p>In addition to encouraging groups to be pro-active, we make several efforts to capture contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will take attendance in lectures and sections that include a project-related activity.
The project and your commitment to your group are a key component of this course.
If you will need to be absent, email your group and the course staff beforehand.</li>
<li>We will collect contribution statements throughout the project sequence.</li>
<li>We will collect confidential group feedback at two major points in the project sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information will be factored into an individual's grade for Participation.
If necessary, we may also further adjust an individual's grade for the Group Project.</p>
<h3 id="contribution-statements">Contribution Statements</h3>
<p>Group submissions will require a contribution statement.
This statement should indicate the name of each member of your team,
the percentage of effort that each member contributed in that specific assignment,
and a corresponding list of specific activities.
An example contribution statement might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Name 1</em>: 40%, researched the background of the problem, outlined the content of the document, wrote the first version of one paragraph, selected the images to be included</li>
<li><em>Name 2</em>: 15%, conducted 3 interviews (with <em>Name 4</em>) and took notes</li>
<li><em>Name 3</em>: 20%, wrote the first version of the background section, made sure the final document was submitted</li>
<li><em>Name 4</em>: 25%, organized the group meeting, conducted 3 interviews (with <em>Name 2</em>), put together the first draft of the document's results section</li>
</ul>
<p>Contribution statements should be submitted together with your milestone submission,
as a separate PDF using the Canvas &quot;Add Another File&quot; capability.
When a contribution statement is required, we will not grade submissions until the contribution statement is provided.</p>
<p>You should discuss and agree upon this statement of what you each contributed and how much this contributed to the overall assignment.</p>
<p>Contribution statements are intended to support your own reflection as a team as well as staff awareness of your efforts.
The staff does not necessarily expect each person to contribute equally to each assignment,
but does expect all members will appropriately contribute over the quarter and will work as a team to support each other.
The staff also understands that percentages are incomplete and subjective,
so we gather them only as a summary indication and will not use them directly in any grade calculation.</p>
<p>If you feel your team's contribution statement does not appropriately convey team contributions, you may email the course staff.
If you feel a member of your team is not contributing appropriately, you may email the course staff.</p>
<h3 id="group-feedback">Group Feedback</h3>
<p>Course staff will request confidential group feedback at the midpoint and the conclusion of the project sequence.</p>
<p>Submit this using the form distributed to the class by email.</p>
