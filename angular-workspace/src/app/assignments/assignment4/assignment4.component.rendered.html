<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>You have identified a problem, explored a design space, selected a promising design, and iterated on that design.
It is now time to focus on communicating your design and your design process.
This group assignment communicates your design through a <strong>poster</strong> and a <strong>video prototype</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="milestones">Milestones</h2>
<p>This is a group assignment, consisting of six milestones.</p>

<h3 id="id-4a-initial-poster-and-pitch">4a: Initial Poster and Pitch</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_4a }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to create a poster and a pitch that communicate your design to a broad audience.</p>
<p>Create a poster that communicates your design and your design process.
Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects.
Your poster should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Title</li>
<li>Logo</li>
<li>Your Names</li>
<li>Problem</li>
<li>Value Proposition</li>
<li>Key Functionality</li>
<li>Design Process and Iteration</li>
</ul>
<p>Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text.
For consistency and ease of display, it should be 32&quot;x40&quot; (i.e., portrait, vertical).
A PowerPoint template is available here:</p>
<app-generated-link linkHREF="/assets/samples/4a/poster_template.ppt">Cow Project PowerPoint template</app-generated-link>
<p>You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project.</p>
<p>During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a small group of judges.
Create a pitch that summarizes the problem and your design.
This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth investigating and that your design suggests a compelling direction.</p>

<h4 id="submission">Submission</h4>
<p>Submit your poster via Canvas here:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ page.link_project_4a }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>
<p>Due to challenges that frequently arise in printing, submit both:</p>
<ul>
<li>a PDF of your poster</li>
<li>the source file for your poster (e.g., PPT, PPTX)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-Class Exercise</strong>:
In addition to your submission, bring two 8.5&quot;x11&quot; printed copies of your poster to class (i.e., color prints on normal-sized paper).
You will need these for in-class critique.</p>

<p>This milestone will be graded on a scale of <strong>10 points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content</strong>: (5 points)
<ul>
<li>Includes all of the key content listed above</li>
<li>Key functionality of the design is clear</li>
<li>Gives insight into the design process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clarity and Presentation</strong>: (5 points)
<ul>

<h3 id="id-4b-initial-video">4b: Initial Video</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_4b }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to create a video that communicates your design to a broad audience.</p>
<p>Working from your prior storyboards or new storyboards, create a video that illustrates your proposed design.
Be sure your video conveys all of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the problem</li>
<li>the design</li>
<li>the context</li>
<li>the satisfaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the examples provided in lecture, as well as videos from prior classes, for insights into creating an effective video.</p>
<p>Your video must not be more than 2 minutes long. It is critical that your video be short enough to remain engaging while delivering its content.</p>
<p>You are required to include appropriate captions for the accessibility of your video.
The staff has prepared simple instructions on how to do that using a script of your video together with YouTube's captioning tools:</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
<p><app-generated-link linkHREF="https://canvas.uw.edu/files/53767196/download?download_frd=1">https://canvas.uw.edu/files/53767196/download?download_frd=1</app-generated-link></p>
</div>
<p>Be sure to check the quality of the resulting captions and correct them as necessary.</p>
