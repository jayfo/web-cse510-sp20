<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Even when a problem is well-motivated, understanding that problem and choosing a design to pursue is a difficult process.
This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem of selecting the right design through
<strong>design research</strong>, <strong>task development</strong>, <strong>generating multiple potential designs</strong>, and finally <strong>selecting a design</strong> to pursue.</p>
<h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>
<p>This is a group assignment, consisting of nine milestones.</p>

<h3 id="id-2a-project-ideation">2a: Project Ideation</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2a }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to begin thinking about how to plan effective design research to inform your design process.</p>
<p>Generate 5 to 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects of your project proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed (e.g., wearable sensors, watch/phone/tablet, desktop, appliances or other artifacts in the environment).</li>
<li>Data: types of data a design might track or help a person track.</li>
<li>Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.</li>
<li>Features: a specific capability a design might have.</li>
<li>Social Interactions: types of social interactions and situations a design might engage or support.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will provide large sheets of paper. Divide a large sheet of paper into 32 squares, each approximately 2in by 2in.
Sketch your ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea.
A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.</p>
<p>The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some individual possibility.
Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea.
You may include ideas from existing products, but no two ideas should be alike.
When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.</p>
<p>After this brainstorming, you will have a broad space of possible directions.
Your project will soon need to gather information on how to generate and consider ideas in these directions.
Following up on the above, additionally brainstorm:</p>
<ul>
<li>People: types of people you might work with to learn more about problems and opportunities.</li>
<li>Focus: what parts of the problems and opportunities you might focus on learning more about.</li>
<li>Method: how you might engage those people to learn more about problems and opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="submission-and-grading">Submission and Grading</h4>
<p>There is no submission for this milestone.
It will be completed in section and graded as part of participation.</p>
<h3 id="id-2b-design-research-plan">2b: Design Research Plan</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2b }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your design research,
encouraging you to work through details of how you would conduct that research
and improving those details through critique and peer feedback.</p>
<p>As part of Assignment 2, you are required to conduct design research
(e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations)
to learn from at least <strong>three</strong> people who might use your design.</p>
<p>In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design and other stakeholders to consider in your design.
Among potential stakeholders, describe the <strong>participants</strong> you plan to pursue,
including such details as their background and the environment where you will examine their current practices.
Give enough information to convince us that you can actually find and engage with your target participants in the next week.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, your target participants should not be &quot;doctors&quot; but instead a specific group of doctors
(e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic).
If gaining access to the target participants is non-trivial (e.g., as with busy doctors),
describe the steps you have already taken to gain access and your plans to recover if you are unable to gain access.
Indicate when you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>In another paragraph, describe the <strong>specific design research methods</strong> you will use to engage with and learn from these people.
A typical expected method would be contextual inquiry with three participants.
However,  we encourage you to propose alternative or additional design research methods according to your needs.
Please be as specific as possible, providing relevant details for you proposed methods. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you propose contextual inquiries, discuss current behaviors you want to observe and your planned focus.</li>
<li>If you propose interviews, discuss the types of questions you plan to explore.</li>
<li>If you propose a diary study, discuss what type of data you plan to ask participants to bring or collect.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a second page, provide more detail regarding your primary proposed method. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you propose contextual inquiries, enumerate what activities you intend to observe,
what focus you intend to bring to observation of each activity,
and any strategies you intend to pursue for gaining insight through your observations.</li>
<li>If you propose interviews, give an example set of planned talking points.</li>
<li>If you propose a diary study, give details of what and how you will ask participants to diary.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="id-2c-design-research-check-in">2c: Design Research Check-In</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2c }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to begin your design research,
reflect on what you observe and learn,
then update your plans for additional design research.</p>
<p>Complete design research with at least one participant prior to this check-in.
You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design,
but also about effectively conducting your design research.</p>
<p>Describe your first design research participant and your findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.</li>
<li>What did you learn?</li>
<li>What tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?</li>
<li>Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?</li>
</ul>
<p>Discuss what remains to be pursued in your additional design research.
We fully expect changes will be necessary, as design research
can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are your plans for the remaining participants?</li>
<li>How do you plan to change your design research plan based on what you learned with your first participant?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="id-2d-design-research-review">2d: Design Research Review</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2d }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and learned in your design research,
organizing observations around themes and developing insights into tasks that can help inform your design.</p>
<h4 id="themes">Themes</h4>
<p>Complete design research with a total of at least three participants. Discuss your process and what you learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.</li>
<li>Note anything unique about each participant and comment on the rationale behind these observations.</li>
<li>What did you learn?</li>
<li>What tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?</li>
</ul>
<p>Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify high-level themes and problems the participants share in their practices.</li>
<li>Do these themes, problems, and practices suggest tasks that are important to design for?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems, and practices,
it may indicate a need to develop additional understanding through more design research.
Because your findings at this point are critical to setting a foundation for your project,
ensure your design research has provided you the insights and perspective you need to proceed.</p>
<h4 id="task-analysis-questions">Task Analysis Questions</h4>
<p>Informed by your design research, provide brief answers to the following questions.
These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who is going to use the design?</li>
<li>What tasks do they now perform?</li>
<li>What tasks are desired?</li>
<li>How are the tasks learned?</li>
<li>Where are the tasks performed?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between the person and data?</li>
<li>What other tools does the person have?</li>
<li>How do people communicate with each other?</li>
<li>How often are the tasks performed?</li>
<li>What are the time constraints on the tasks?</li>
<li>What happens when things go wrong?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="id-2e-task-review">2e: Task Review</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2e }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop a set of tasks that you will explore in a set of potential designs.</p>
<p>Building on what you learned in your design research, design <strong>six tasks</strong> that you believe are important to your design goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it.</li>
<li>Select tasks to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage of designs you will explore.</li>
<li>Create tasks based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks (i.e., tasks people already do)
as well as your vision for new tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your design).</li>
<li>These should be real world tasks that include details
(e.g., instead of &quot;programming a DVR&quot;, details like &quot;programming a DVR to record Spongebob on Sundays&quot;).</li>
<li>These tasks should not have any specific relation to the potential designs you will brainstorm in later milestones.</li>
<li>Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty, from easy tasks to hard tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each task should be described in text.
Be sure that your task conveys a problem and what is accomplished, rather than a step-by-step walkthrough of scenario with a specific design.</p>
<p>As you progress in your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks.
Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive.
The tasks you develop in this milestone therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.</p>

<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2f }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to develop distinct design ideas that address your tasks.</p>
<p>You have identified and described six important tasks for your design problem.
You will now brainstorm and sketch three very different <strong>initial designs</strong> for your interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each design should support four of your tasks, but they do not necessarily need to all support the same four tasks.</li>
<li>Sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality in your four tasks.
A design may imply additional tasks, but do not illustrate the entire design.</li>
<li>These should be rough sketches on paper (i.e., not digital mockups),
including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.</p>

<h4 id="submission-5">Submission</h4>
<p>No more than three pages of text in PDF format:</p>
<ul>
<li>six task descriptions (one paragraph each, updated as needed from prior assignment)</li>
<li>for each of three initial designs
<ul>
<li>the high-level idea of the design (one paragraph)</li>
<li>scanned images of the design (sketches, not digital mockups)</li>
<li>how to complete each of the four sketched tasks (e.g., a list of steps, one or two sentences per task)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free.
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.</p>
<p>Submit via Canvas here:</p>

<h3 id="id-2g-design-review-1x2">2g: Design Review (&quot;1x2&quot;)</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2g }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to choose a design idea to pursue in the remainder of this course.</p>
<p>From your design sketches, select one design that you will refine in the remainder of this course.
Then select two tasks that will be the focus of your design refinement.
The selected tasks need to be representative of the experience of using your design.
They should be non-trivial, critical to solving your problem, and should emphasize long-lived or repeated activities.
In contrast, a one-time login screen for a social networking application
is not worth being the focus of your project, does not define your project functionality, and is not sufficiently interesting.</p>
<p>Prepare one paragraph describing <em>why you selected the design and tasks</em> you did.
Draw upon feedback from critiques and data from your design research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why this design and these tasks?</li>
<li>What makes the design better suited to the people for whom you are targeting your design?</li>
<li>Why are these tasks more compelling than the others?</li>
</ul>
<p>Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks you chose, and why you chose them.</p>
<p>Then <em>create a storyboard of each task</em> for your selected design.
These should be done on paper, then scanned (i.e., do not create or recreate them in a drawing package).
They should clearly indicate the functionality of the design and what the interface will be like,
conveying the major aspects of the design in enough detail that a person not in your group can understand
how the design supports each task.
As needed, add descriptions that explicitly reference the storyboard, add more sketches, or annotate them in multiple colors.</p>

<h3 id="id-2p-presentation">2p: Presentation</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2p }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design research in a presentation.</p>
<p>Prepare a presentation of your process in getting the right design. It should encompass all of your work in Assignment 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two members of your team should deliver the presentation, each speaking to relatively equal portions.</li>
<li>A seven minute time limit will be strictly enforced, with additional time for questions.</li>
<li>Presenters should be different from those for Assignment 3, such that everybody presents at least once this quarter.
If there is some reason this cannot work for your team, be sure you have communicated with us.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your presentation should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Title Slide</strong>:</p>
<p>A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.</p>
<p>Include team member names. Be clear which team members are presenting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overall Problem</strong>:</p>
<p>Convey that your problem is both important and appropriate for a design investigation.</p>
<p>Motivate your audience to be interested in your problem.
Consider using data or statistics regarding importance of the problem.
Consider using a scenario or story to convey an emotional or human perspective on the problem.
Be sure to avoid simply reading slide bullets, as you need to develop a connection to your audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Research</strong>:</p>
<p>Convey what design research you conducted. This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>your methods (i.e., what design research did you do),</li>
<li>your participants (i.e., what participants did you engage),</li>
<li>your key findings (i.e., what key things did you learn that will inform your design).</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider including images that give your audience a feeling for your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>6 Tasks</strong>:</p>
<p>Convey the breadth of tasks you have considered, in at most one sentence per task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3 Design Sketches</strong>:</p>
<p>Convey the breadth of designs you considered.</p>
<p>Be clear what is the key idea or difference in each of your three designs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selected Design Storyboards and Tasks</strong>:</p>
<p>Present your storyboards, ensuring they effectively illustrate your selected design and tasks.</p>
<p>Convey your rationale for choosing this as a design focus.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We strongly recommend rehearsing your presentation beforehand.
For example, arrange to practice together with another group or two, giving each other feedback on your presentations.</p>
<p>Note that we have not set a required number of slides in each section of this presentation.
You can deliver your presentation using as many or as few slides as you want,
as long as your presentation successfully addresses the above points in the allowed time.</p>

<p>Your presentation may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format.</p>
<p>To minimize switching time, we will have all presentations on a single laptop running Microsoft Windows.
You should optimize your presentation for portability (e.g., ensure any necessary fonts are embedded).
If we detect any obvious formatting issues on the presentation machine, we may fix them or contact you to fix them.
But you are ultimately responsible for your presentation.</p>

<p>The content of this presentation will be graded on a scale of <strong>16 points</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentations should not have an outline slide.
They are short enough to be told as a story of your process, and your outline is the same as every other presentation.
Instead use that time to tell us about your project.</li>
<li>The problem should be presented in a manner that is compelling and achievable.</li>
<li>Design research should be carried out and presented in an appropriate manner.
This should include methods, participants, and key findings.</li>
<li>Tasks should provide coverage of envisioned functionality and be motivated by the design research.</li>
<li>Design ideas should be distinct and have a connection to results of design research.</li>
<li>The selected design and task storyboards should be compelling and have a connection to results of design research.</li>
<li>Presentations should show appropriate preparation,
with slides that are legible and content that is effective, properly prepared, and properly employed.</li>
<li>Presentations should cover the required scope within the allowed time.</li>

<h3 id="id-2web-getting-the-right-design">2web: Getting the Right Design</h3>
<p><app-assignment-due-text dueText="{{ page.due_project_2web }}"></app-assignment-due-text></p>
<p>The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design research in a post appropriate for a web portfolio.</p>
<p>Prepare a post documenting your process of getting the right design.
Your post will be integrated into the course website via a Projects page,
used to both advertise the course poster session and to provide an archive of course projects.
Your post should follow the outline below, and you will also need to provide:
(1) a project title, (2) a project thumbnail, and (3) an image and preferred name for each member of the project team.</p>
<p>The outline and its description of what to include in each section is intended to help convey your design process.
For example, you might begin your section on identified tasks by saying &quot;<em>We focused our design exploration around 6 tasks.</em>&quot;,
thus mirroring the outline's language regarding your overall design process.
Each section suggests an organization that will often be effective,
but you should adapt the section as appropriate to your specific design process.</p>
<p>Your prior milestones provide significant content you can draw upon in this post,
but this post is intended for an audience of future readers reviewing your design work.
Not all of the content from prior milestones is included (e.g., the Task Analysis is not included),
you should update your prior work based on feedback received throughout your design process,
and you may choose to omit elements of your work that were ultimately less relevant to your design process.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Title</strong></p>
<p>A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Problem and Solution Overview</strong>:</p>
<p>A concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a brief introduction of your proposed solution.</p>
<p>This could be organized as two short paragraphs: one introducing the problem and one introducing your solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Research Goals, Methods, and Participants</strong>:</p>
<p>Describe the goals of your design research (i.e., your focus, your primary need for additional understanding),
the methods you applied in your design research toward these goals,
and the participants you engaged in your design research.
Describe why you chose your specific methods and participants.</p>
<p>This could be a chronological account of your design research,
explaining how you combined multiple methods over time (e.g., a survey and then follow-up interviews)
or how your design research goals evolved across participants (e.g., a major pivot after an interview).</p>
<p>Minimize how much this section reveals about your results,
including only what may be necessary to explain your methods and participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design Research Results and Themes</strong>:</p>
<p>Discuss the key insights and themes that emerged in your design research
(e.g., common needs, common practices, critical breakdowns, identified opportunities).
Use specific evidence whenever possible
(e.g., quotes or stories from participants, pictures captured during observations),
so that readers know that insights and themes are based in design research data.</p>
<p>This could be organized as a short introduction followed by a paragraph for each insight or theme.
Each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight or theme,
then several sentences explaining the specific evidence or other design research data supporting the insight or theme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identified Tasks</strong>:</p>
<p>Present 6 tasks around which you decided to focus your design exploration.
Provide brief justification for each task, based in your design research.</p>
<p>This could be organized as a short introduction followed by a short paragraph for each task.
Each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the task,
then another sentence explaining the specific evidence or other design research data supporting the task.
For example, the latter sentence might explain that an existing task was commonly described by participants,
might explain how a critical breakdown identified by a participant motivates importance of the task,
or might describe how a theme identified in design research suggests a new task.</p>
<p>Remember tasks describe design-agnostic objectives that people accomplish.
Although you may have also developed detailed scenarios or personas,
tasks in this section should be relatively brief and focused on
what people need or want to accomplish in the space your designs will address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proposed Design Sketches</strong>:</p>
<p>Present 3 distinct designs that each take a different approach to your problem
and are each motivated by your design research.
Explain the key ideas in each design
and include one or more images of your sketches for each design.
Be sure your explanation and images are sufficient for understanding each design
and for also understanding how the designs are distinct from each other.</p>
<p>This could be organized as a short introduction that names each design followed by a paragraph for each design.
Each paragraph could include one or more images of your sketches for that design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selected Design and Storyboards</strong>:</p>
<p>Present: (1) the design you will develop in the remainder of the course,
(2) a justification for why you chose that design based on your design research,
and (3) images of your storyboards illustrating 2 tasks with your design.
Be sure your storyboards appropriately illustrate key elements of your design
and communicate how a person will accomplish the task using your design.</p>
<p>This could be organized as an introductory paragraph justifying a selected design,
or could instead justify a decision to take key elements from multiple designs in a new design.
Storyboards could be presented together with written scenarios
describing steps a person will go through to accomplish the tasks using your design,
thus providing additional detail necessary for interpreting and understanding your storyboards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensure your post is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>text should be clear and concise</li>
<li>use section headings and formatting as appropriate</li>
<li>include images in the body of the post</li>
<li>check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors</li>
</ul>
<!-- Samples from Prior Offerings -->

<app-generated-link linkHREF="https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b">https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b</app-generated-link>
<p>Author your post such that it conveys the necessary content while remaining easy to skim and read within approximately 7 minutes.
We estimate posts will be between 1500 and 2000 words in length.</p>
<p>You post must be a plain text file, formatted in Markdown syntax:</p>
<app-generated-link linkHREF="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax</app-generated-link>
<p>Name the file <code>designresearch.md</code>. In addition to your Markdown file, you will also need to provide:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>A Project Thumbnail</strong>:
A 150x150 image appropriate as a thumbnail for your project, named <code>project_thumb.png</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An image and preferred name for each member of the project team</strong>:
Similar to the images of the course staff on the overall course website, these will be included in the pages generated for your project.
Provide a file <code>names.txt</code> that includes how you want your names presented on the course website.
Then provide an appropriately named image for each member of the project team (e.g., <code>james.png</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All images referenced by your Markdown file</strong>:
These will be placed in the same directory as your rendered Markdown file.
Instead of Markdown's image syntax, consider incorporating <code>img</code> tags directly in your Markdown,
thus allowing you to specify the rendering size of the image.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Submit via Canvas here:</p>
<p><app-assignment-submission-link linkSubmission="{{ page.link_project_2web }}"></app-assignment-submission-link></p>
<p>Names of participants should be replaced with pseudonyms in all documents.
It is important to protect participant anonymity, even in the case that reporting seems harmless.</p>
